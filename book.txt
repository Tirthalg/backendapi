Vachanamrut
Throughout His lifetime on Earth, Swaminarayan Bhagvan (Shreeji Maharaj) educated the masses through His spiritual and philosophical discussions. The subject matter included svadharma atma-gnan, vairagya, gnan of Bhagvan's svarup, and bhakti coupled with Bhagvan's greatness. The great sants, Muktanand Swami, Gopalanand Swami, Nityanand Swami, Brahmanand Swami, and Shukanand Swami catalogued thousands of these discussions word for word, so that future haribhaktas could have the fortune of Swaminarayan Bhagvan's divine words. This compilation of discussions came to be known as the 'Vachanamrut' - ' vachan' (speech) and 'amrut' (nectar). This shastra contains the sweet words of Swaminarayan Bhagvan which are the nectar our jeev desires; like nectar they provide us with a way to eternal happiness in His Akshardham. The Vachanamrut is a shastra of 'upasana', whereas the Shikshapatri is a shastra of 'agna'. The Vachanamrut is compiled of 273 sabhas ranging from Vikram Samvat years 1876 to 1886. The talks of these sabhas were carefully chosen by Swaminarayan Bhagvan Himself for inclusion in the Vachanamrut. It is divided into eleven sections, based on the various villages in which the talks were delivered. Within each section, individual Vachanamruts are arranged in chronological order, and are numbered. However, one Vachanamrut is not related to the next, allowing them to be read in any order. Prior to the 273 Vachanamruts there is a section known as Partharo. It provides a meticulous description of Swaminarayan Bhagvan's daily activities, His association with bhaktas, and details about His body and mannerisms. This description allows bhaktas to visualise Swaminarayan Bhagvan, and strengthen their devotion. The Vachanamrut is full of wonderful unique features which enable the reader and listener to move closer to Swaminarayan Bhagvan. In particular, a person is drawn to the intricate details contained in the first paragraph of each Vachanamrut. The paragraph contains an exact description of the time and surroundings in which the sabha took place. It also depicts the exact position of Swaminarayan Bhagvan and His appearance. Not only does this authenticate the shastra as being true, but it also allows haribhaktas to imagine themselves sitting in His sabhas. The Vachanamrut is such a profound shastra, that in order to understand its contents it is vital that the reader and listener concentrate their mind on Swaminarayan Bhagvan Himself, and not only on the environment in which the discussion took place. The issues raised in the Vachanamrut are quite varied, ranging from deeply philosophical and theological subjects, such as the nature of Bhagvan, creation of the universe, clarifications of the classical Hindu philosophies of acharyas, to more spiritually practical subjects such as the kalyan of the jeev, good and bad company, and the means of attaining eternal happiness. Regardless of the subject, Swaminarayan Bhagvan had the gift of clearly and elegantly explaining complex concepts through simple examples. In fact, even the uneducated villagers sitting in the sabha were able to grasp profound philosophical concepts due to His use of simple language and meaningful examples. Instead of opting for a monologue style of speaking, Swaminarayan Bhagvan delivered His talks in the form of a discussion, like the method used by the rushis in the Upanishads. At times, Swaminarayan Bhagvan would pose a question to the members of the sabha, or sometimes He would ask the sabha to pose a question to Him. On some occasions, members of the sabha would ask a question directly. In His sabhas, all were free to question and even to counter-question, regardless of whether they were educated tyagis or simple grahasthas. Even though the sabha was graced by many learned scholars, Swaminarayan Bhagvan was able to provide gratifying answers to the questions posed. Not only does this confirm His status as the Purushottam Narayan, but it also illustrates that whatever guidance we receive from the Vachanamrut, it is from Swaminarayan Bhagvan Himself. The authenticity of the Vachanamrut is further demonstrated by Swaminarayan Bhagvan in Vachanamrut Gadhada II – 28, in which He says, "I have delivered this talk to you after hearing and extracting the essence from the Veds, the six-shastras, the Purans, and all other words on this earth relating to moksh. This is the most profound and fundamental principle, and it is the essence of all essences" . This illustrates that the talks delivered by Swaminarayan Bhagvan were not created in His mind, but as a result of His practical experiences, which He reveals in Gadhada III – 39: "I deliver these talks to you not from any imagination of my mind, nor to display any sort of skill. I have experienced all that I have spoken about. In fact, I speak in accordance to what I practice" . Simply striving to understand the words of the Vachanamrut does not lead to the true knowledge of its contents. This knowledge is revealed only by the grace of Swaminarayan Bhagvan. This grace is attained after constant reading of the Vachanamrut. Just as it is difficult to obtain amrut, it is difficult to obtain the true knowledge of the Vachanamrut. It is not a shastra to be casually read like a book of fiction; it is a book to be lived with, and read over and over again. Each time a person thinks over the contents of the Vachanamrut, new knowledge is revealed. Some people think it is a difficult shastra to read and do not make any effort towards studying it. Ordinary books on philosophy and spirituality topics are difficult to read and only appeal to educated scholars. However, Swaminarayan Bhagvan has put the best of the spiritual knowledge in the simplest of forms. Therefore, 'Vachanamrut' is the perfect name for this shastra, as it is amrut in the form of the words of Swaminarayan Bhagvan. Just as amrut has the distinct property of granting freedom from death (immortality), the words of Bhagvan similarly grant freedom from the cycle of births and deaths to all those who strive for their wisdom, and immortality and eternal bliss in Akshardham. The Vachanamrut has been translated into English for the benefit of satsangis who find reading and understanding Gujarati difficult. The reader can rest assure that this translation has been made directly from an authenticated version of the Vachanamrut published by Shree Swaminarayan Mandir, Bhuj. However, as no translation can do true justice to the original text, we advise that the Gujarati Vachanamrut should be read with this English Vachanamrut being used as a reference where needed. To translate this shastra was truly a profound task. It was vital to ensure that the amrut vani (divine words) of Swaminarayan Bhagvan were not lost in translation. Each sentence has been translated in the same order as the Gujarati version to ensure that the true meanings of the talks are maintained accurately. However, certain concepts in the Vachanamrut simply have no equivalent English words or phrases, so the original Gujarati or Sanskrit words have been kept. The reader is advised to make full use of the glossary to understand the meanings of these words. The glossary is a unique tool in assisting the reader to understand the essence of the Vachanamrut. It not only contains an explanation of words that cannot be translated, but also words that can be translated but the English equivalent does not provide a true meaning. Also, the Sanskrit shloks have been transcribed and translated, and hyphens have been added in these shloks to aid in the reading of long Sanskrit words. Also, some complete shloks have been included at times in order to aid its translation. Finally, to aid memory and understanding, paragraph breaks have been added, even though the original manuscripts of the Vachanamrut did not have paragraph breaks at all. These paragraph breaks allow the reader to easily grasp and memorise concepts. With the murti of Swaminarayan Bhagvan in our hearts, we have attempted to do justice to this powerful scripture. We apologise in advance for any mistakes we may have made along the way, as no version will ever be as good as the Gujarati Vachanamrut, as only that version contains the divine words spoken directly by Swaminarayan Bhagvan Himself. We pray that He is pleased with our attempt to spread His amrut vani in this modern era.


Partharo

Bhagvan and His Akshardham
In the midst of Golok is Bhagvan's Akshardham. It is full of light which is brighter than millions of suns, moons, and fire; it is divya and is extremely white . It is sachidanand, and is called Brahmpur, Amrutdham, Parampad, Anant-Apar, Brahm, and Chidakash. Such is Akshardham in which Shree Krishna Bhagvan eternally resides. Bhagvan is known as Purushottam, Vasudev, Narayan, Paramatma, Brahm, Parbrahm, Ishvar, Parameshvar, and Vishnu. Bhagvan is beyond the mortal and immortal beings, omniscient, all-doer, the lord of all, antaryami, and the cause of all causes. He is nirgun, luminous, independent, and is worthy of worship by innumerable muktas. The leelas of Bhagvan include the creation, sustenance, and destruction of countless brahmands. He gives power to Prakruti-Purush, Kal, Pradhan-Purush, and maha- tattva. He is the lord of all brahmands, and is in the eternal svarup of an adolescent, which is more beautiful than millions of Kam-Devs. His complexion is dark blue, like that of a fresh cloud. He is wearing exquisite clothes and jewellery, such as crocodile-shaped earrings and a beautiful crown encrusted with precious jewels. His eyes are as beautiful as the petals of a lotus that flourish in the season of Sharad. Fragrant sandalwood paste has been applied to His body. He is playing a delightful melody on His bamboo flute, and Radhikaji and Lakshmiji are performing His seva. He is holding a chakra, a padma, a gada, and a shankh, and is worshipped by countless parshads, including Nand, Sunand, and Shreedama. His murti is brighter than the light of millions of suns and moons. He possesses great powers, and immeasurable kalyan-kari gun, such as dharma, gnan, and vairagya. Also, the siddhis worship His lotus feet, and the four Veds praise His greatness and glory. The Vishvarup form, the twenty-four four-armed svarups, and avatars such as Varah, originate from Him. The great Shree Krishna Bhagvan has taken birth on earth, in Kaushal-Desh, with all His powers, to spread ekantik dharma; to protect and to give happiness to His ekantik bhaktas, such as Dharma, Bhakti, and the rushis; to grant kalyan to innumerable jeevs; and to eradicate adharma.

The Incarnation Of Shree Swaminarayan Bhagvan
Once, Marichi and the other rushis went to Badrikashram for darshan of Shree Nar-Narayan. After hearing of this, Dharma-Dev and Murti-Devi also went for darshan of Shree Nar-Narayan. After they had all performed darshan of Shree Nar-Narayan, they took their seats in the sabha, which consisted of many rushis and Uddhavji. The rushis were describing to Shree Nar-Narayan the conditions of Bharat-Khand (Earth). Then, while Narayan was speaking to the sabha, everyone was listening to Him with full concentration. At that time, Durvasa Rushi arrived from Kailas to perform darshan of Shree Nar-Narayan. However, his arrival was not acknowledged, and he was not welcomed. Therefore, he cursed the entire sabha and said, "Those who have dishonoured me will be born on Bharat-Khand as humans and will suffer the torture that the demons thrust upon you". Upon hearing this, Dharma-Dev tried to calm Durvasa Rushi. Durvasa Rushi then said, "I cursed you because I did not know that you were in a conversation with Shree Nar-Narayan, and because of this you, did not see me and welcome me. The curse cannot be retracted, but I will give you some relief. Dharma-Dev and Murti-Devi will be born into brahman families and Shree Narayan will be born to you as a son. He will free you and these rushis from my curse, and will protect you all from the demons" . Saying this, Durvasa Rushi returned to Kailas. Then, Shree Narayan said to everyone, "If it was my wish, I could have retracted this curse that you have received without any fault. However at this time, the effects of Kali-Yug are prevalent on Bharat-Khand, and therefore the demons are in full force. In order to destroy them, I have accepted this curse. Therefore, as the son of Dharma-Dev, I shall destroy the demons and protect you all, and will establish ekantik-dharma throughout Bharat-Khand. You should not worry, and should take birth as humans on Bharat-Khand" . Hearing these words, everyone bowed to Shree Narayan and left the sabha to make preparations for their birth on earth.

Dharma-Dev and Bhakti-Devi
In Kaushal-Desh there was a village known as Itar. In the village lived a Sarvariya Sam-Vedi brahman named Bal-Sharma Pande and his wife Bhagyavati. Dharma-Dev was born to them in Samvat year 1796, on the afternoon of Kartik sudi 11. His father named him as Dev-Sharma on the twelfth day of his birth with full religious rites. In Chhapaiya, there lived a Travadi brahman named Krishna-Sharma and his wife Bhavani. Murti-Devi was born to them in the Samvat year 1798, on the evening of Kartik sudi 15 Punam. As she got older, her bhakti for Shree Krishna increased, and she was therefore known as Bhakti. Krishna-Sharma arranged for his daughter Bhakti to be married to Dev-Sharma, son of Bal-Sharma. Krishna-Sharma kept his son-in-law at his house in Chhapaiya. Dev-Sharma and Bhakti-Devi followed the dharma of the grahastha ashram whilst offering loving bhakti to Shree Krishna. As Dev-Sharma was so strict in his dharma, he became known as Dharma-Dev. Dharma-Dev and Bhakti-Devi were harassed immensely by demons. To ease this suffering, they went to Vrundavan and prayed to Shree Krishna with the rushis. This pleased Bhagvan, so He gave them darshan of Himself in the same svarup that He resides in Akshardham. He said, "Dharma-Dev and Bhakti-Devi. The demons that torture you now are the demons I had killed in my Krishna avatar. They desire revenge upon me. They know that you are my own, which is why they trouble you. To destroy these demons, I will be born to you as Narayan Rushi, with the name Hari-Krishna. I will protect you from them and free you from Durvasa Rushi's curse. I will destroy the demons and adharma, and establish ekantik dharma on earth" . The murti of Shree Krishna Bhagvan then disappeared, and entered the heart of Dharma-Dev. Dharma-Dev and Bhakti-Devi returned to Chhapaiya with great happiness, and offered bhakti to Shree Krishna Bhagvan. As Bhagvan was extremely pleased with Dharma-Dev, he also became known as Hari-Prasad. After many months, Shree Krishna Bhagvan was born to Hari-Prasad and Bhakti-Devi in the Samvat year 1837, on the evening of Chaitra sudi 9 at 10.10pm. He was surrounded by a bright light. A grand celebration took place at the house of Hari-Prasad. The devs came shouting "Jay! Jay!", playing drums, and showering flowers. The apsaras came dancing, whilst the gandharvas sang songs, and the rushis offered blessings. The minds of devs and sadhus were extremely pleased, whilst the demons were in despair. The women of the village were singing auspicious songs, and were blessing Bhagvan in the svarup of a newborn baby. A mild, fragrant, cool, and a gentle breeze was present in the air. The stars sparkled amidst the clear night sky. Also, due to the birth of Bhagvan, Chhapaiya became like Akshardham. Then, Hari-Prasad had the birth ceremony performed for his son by many brahmans, and he gave them various types of alms in return. On the sixth day of the birth of the Bhagvan, Kotra (an evil witch) and other demons came to kill Bhagvan in His infant svarup. However, when Bhagvan looked at them, they were burnt and were driven away. When Bhagvan attained the tender age of three months and eleven days, Markandey Rushi went to the house of Hari-Prasad. Hari-Prasad welcomed him warmly and recognised him to be a great astrologer. He then said, "Please perform the naming ceremony of our son" . Markandey Rushi happily said, "Hari-Prasad. This son of yours will relieve you and His followers from all difficulties and troubles. As He was born in Kark Rashi, He shall be called Hari. Also, He your son shall be known as Krishna, as He has got a slightly dark complexion, He will always attract the minds of His followers, and He was born in the month of Chaitra. Though Hari and Krishna are two separate names, He will also have a third name Hari-Krishna, which is the union of Hari and Krishna. "As your son will have the five gun of tyag, gnan, tap, dharma, and yog. He will be like Shivji, and will therefore be known as Nilkanth throughout the world. Your son has the mark of a padma on His palm, and vajra, urdhva-rekha and kamal on His feet, which shows that He will be the lord of millions of people. He will also possess countless kalyan-kari gun, and will protect you from all misery and suffering". Hari-Prasad then offered money, costly new garments, and jewellery to Markandey Rushi. He stayed there for one day, and then left for pilgrimage to Prayag. Hari-Prasad and Bhakti-Mata were very pleased to know the gun of their son. Shree Hari pleased His parents and relatives through His leelas, and grew like a crescent moon. Then, when He was five months old, Hari-Prasad started to teach Him to sit. Then, when He was six months old, Hari-Prasad started to teach Him to eat. Then, when He was seven months old, He had His ears pierced. At the start of His third year, the chaul sanskar ceremony was performed. On that same day, a demon named Kalidatt appeared to kill Bhagvan. However, Bhagvan confused Kalidatt by appearing in all directions. Whenever Kalidatt tried to grab Bhagvan, he collided with a tree. This ultimately caused His death. Hari-Prasad then took his family from Chhapaiya to Ayodhya due to the suffering caused by the demons. When Shree Hari reached the age of five, Hari-Prasad taught Him to write His first word. Then, at the age of eight, He gathered puja items and alms from the brahmans, and performed the yagnopavit ceremony. Thereafter, Shree Hari, after receiving the yagnopavit from His father, observed the dharma of a naishtik brahm- chari, and studied the Veds. By reading the shastras and listening to the kathas given by His father, He learnt the hidden meanings of the Veds, the Purans, historical shastras, and Dharma-Shastras, and was able to understand each of these shastras. He took the essence from of each shastra. From the Shreemad Bhagvat, He extracted the essence from the fifth and tenth skandh; from the Skand Puran, He extracted the essence of the Vasudev Mahatmya; from the Mahabharat, He extracted the Vidur-Niti, Vishnu-Sahasranam, and the Bhagvad Geeta; and from all the Dharma-Shastras He extracted the Yagnavalkya Smruti. Shree Hari then compiled a gutko of the essence of all these shastras. At the age of eleven, Shree Hari gave His mother, Bhakti-Mata, the knowledge of bhakti coupled with dharma, gnan, and vairagya. As a result of this, Bhakti-Mata attained Akshardham, and was therefore freed from Durvasa Rushi's curse. After many months, He gave the same knowledge to His father, Hari-Prasad, and also freed him from the curse of Durvasa Rushi. In this way, Hari-Prasad and Bhakti-Devi attained Akshardham, and remain in the constant seva of Shree Hari.

Shree Hari On Van Vichran
Shree Hari left the house with an excuse of going to bathe. However, due to His intense vairagya, He abandoned His family and home, and travelled north to perform tap. Shree Hari wore a small dhoti with a loin-cloth underneath (tied with a grass rope), a white yagnopavit, and a kanthi of tulsi beads around His neck, His long hair was tied in a bun, and He had the mark of the urdhva-pundra tilak and chandlo on His forehead. He carried with Him deer-skin, a wooden T-shaped stick, a kamandalu, an alms-bowl, a piece of cotton to filter water, and a mala in His right hand. Around His neck, He tied a small case containing shaligram, and a murti of Bal-Mukund, and over His shoulder He carried the gutko which contained the essence of the shastras. In this svarup, Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari swam across the River Saryu, and headed north. After walking for many days, He came to a large forest located in the valley of the Himalay Mountains. After walking through the forest for many days, He eventually reached Mukti-Nath, in Nepal. Here, He performed severe tap in order to please Surya-Dev. Then, after many months had passed, He headed south. In the deep valleys of the Himalay Mountains, Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari came across another extremely dense forest, which He travelled through for twelve months. Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari then came across Gopal Yogi, who was sitting under a banyan tree, and was performing tap. He stayed with Gopal Yogi for twelve months and learnt the art of ashtang-yog. Nilkanth Brahm-Chari gave Gopal Yogi the knowledge of His svarup and sent him to Akshardham. Then, He headed north, passed through adi -Varah, and reached Sirpur, in Bengal. The king of Sirpur, Siddh-Vallabh, was very religious. At the request of the king, Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari stayed in Sirpur during the four months of the monsoon season. During this period, He destroyed the pride of evil people who worshipped Kali and Bhairav, and protected Gopaldas, a servant of the king, from their black-magic. In the town, there lived a brahman from the Telang region (part of Andhra-Pradesh and Tamil Nadu). He had originally studied Veds, the Purans, and historical shastras. He had accepted many alms, including an elephant from the king, which he did not deserve. As a result of this, his complexion turned from fair to dark. This brahman took the shelter of Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari for the destruction of his sins. Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari relieved him from his sins and he attained his original fair complexion. Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari later reached a village near the mandir of Kamakshi Devi, where there lived a brahman. He was a worshipper of Maha-Kali, and was terrifying the brahmans and sadhus who came to visit the village. He was using his black-magic to make them his followers. He approached Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari and tried to use his black-magic and sorcery on Him, but was unsuccessful. Instead, Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari rid the brahman of his arrogance and made him a shishya. Later, Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari came to Nav-Lakha Mountain, where there were the seats of 900,000 yogis. In front of these yogis, there were 900,000 flames within a pool of water. Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari gave His darshan to all the yogis, and descended the mountain. Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari then came down to a place called Balva-Kund. From there, He reached the union between the River Ganga and the Bay of Bengal, called Ganga Sagar. After bathing there, He crossed the bay with a small boat, and then went to Kapil ashram. He stayed there for a month, where He daily received the darshan of Kapil-Dev. Progressing onwards, He reached Jagan-Nath-Puri. After staying there for a few months, He destroyed many demons. With His powers, He made them fight amongst themselves in such a way that they killed each other. Then, Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari headed south, reaching a place called adi-Kurma. He then crossed a dense forest, before arriving at Manaspur. The king of Manaspur, Satra-Dharma, became His ashrit. Through the king, Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari destroyed many demons. Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari passed Venkantadri, Shiv Kanchi, and Vishnu Kanchi, and later stayed at Shree-Rang-Kshetra for two months. Through His power and ability, He debated with Vaishnavs, and persuaded them to abandon their immoral behaviour. Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari then went to Setu-Bandh and stayed there for two months. Every day, He took a bath in the ocean and performed darshan of Rameshvar Maha-Dev. He also received the darshan of Vishnu in the svarup of Sunder-Raj. Moving forward, He came across a dense forest, where He kept walking for five days without food and water. On the sixth day, at around midday, He saw a water-well. He bathed with the water that He had taken out of the well using His kamandalu. He sat beneath a banyan tree and carried out His daily puja, including that of shaligram. He placed shaligram in a bowl and started to bathe it by pouring water from the kamandalu. The water did not gather in the bowl, but was absorbed by shaligram. Having emptied roughly seven kamandalus full of water, which was all absorbed by shaligram, He realised that shaligram had now quenched its thirst. He started to perform puja by applying sandalwood paste. At that time He thought, "Shaligram was very thirsty, and must also be hungry, yet I have nothing to offer to Him. What can I give Vishnu?" At that time, Shivji and Parvati arrived there, travelling on Nandishvar, in the disguise of tyagis. They saw Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari in His puja and offered Him sathvo and salt. He mixed the sathvo and salt with water, and offered it to Vishnu in the svarup of shaligram, and then ate it Himself as prasad. From there, He travelled to a place known as Bhut-Puri, where He stayed for the darshan and puja of Shree Ramanuj-acharya. Then, He went to Kumarika, Padmanabh, Janardan, and then had the darshan of Vishnu in the svarup of Adi Keshav. Next, He went to Kulgiri, known as Malayachal, and stayed there for five days, receiving darshan of Vishnu in the svarup of Sakshi Gopal. Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari later went to Pandharpur and stayed there for two months, and received the darshan Vishnu as Vitthal-Nath. Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari then performed pradakshina of a place called Dand-Karanya. He continued His journey and reached Nasikpur, where He received darshan of Trambakeshvar. Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari then crossed River Tapi, River Narmada, River Mahi, and River Sabarmati. Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari then travelled through Bhal region and reached Bhim-Nath. Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari received the darshan of Shiv in the svarup of Gop-Nath, and reached the port of Mangrol. In this way, while on yatra, He destroyed adharma and established ekantik dharma every tirth He visited. He freed the people living there from the ties of worldly affairs by giving them His darshan and accepting food and water offered by them.

Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari In Loj
Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari reached Lojpur in the Samvat year 1856, on Shravan vad 6. He met Ramanand Swami's shishya, Muktanand Swami, and many other sadhus. He acknowledged them as the loyal bhaktas of Shree Krishna Bhagvan and recognised the characteristics of true sadhus. So, He stayed with them. After staying there for several months, He travelled in company of the sadhus to Piplana, located near Mount Girnar. Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari arrived in Piplana in the Samvat year 1856, on Jyeshth vad 12 . There, He met Ramanand Swami, who was staying at the house of Narsinh Mehta. Ramanand Swami was of a large build, had a fair complexion, and was wearing white clothes, which is suitable for a brahm-chari. Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari performed dandvat-pranam before him, greeted him, and then sat beside him. Shree Ramanand Swami was pleased to see Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari. Shree Ramanand Swami asked Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari regarding His birthplace, family, parents, Ved, guru, and ishta-dev. Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari explained His ideas on vairagya, tyag of His family, staying in the forest, various types of tap performed, attainment of ashtang-yog, His yatra, and defeat of false gurus. After hearing all these ideas, Shree Ramanand Swami was extremely pleased and said, "Brahm-Chari. You are my own. Your father Dharma-Dev had taken bhagvati diksha from me at Prayag-Shetra. He had stayed in Kaushal-Desh under my agna, and preached about dharma and bhakti of Shree Krishna to those that had the desire to learn. You are the son of the Dharma-Dev, and have more gun than your father" . Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari was pleased to have heard this, and therefore stayed with Shree Ramanand Swami. In the Samvat year 1857, Kartik sud 11, Shree Nilkanth Brahm-Chari was given bhagvati diksha by Ramanand Swami, and was given the names Sahajanand Swami and Narayan Muni. He remained with Shree Ramanand Swami and served him with great love and admiration. Ramanand Swami realised that Narayan Muni was gifted with all the guns of a true sant and was extremely powerful. Therefore, he handed over the control of the Sampraday to Him. Ramanand Swami then left his physical body in the Samvat year 1858, on Magshar sud 13. He returned to Badrikashram and became free from the curse of Durvasa Rushi. Shree Sahajanand Swami performed the funeral rites of His guru and began to take care of the Sampraday. He was watchful of all the sadhus, brahm- charis, and grahasthas. He achieved this by giving talks based on shastras, which attracted their minds towards Him.

Sahajanand Swami
Shree Sahajanand Swami travelled through many regions, such as Sorath, Halar, Kutch, Zalavad, Kathiyavad, Dandhavya, Bhal and Gujarat, accompanied by His sadhus, brahm- charis, and grahasthas. He revealed His divinity to the people of these regions, and gave inspiring talks on dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti. He also destroyed adharma, and purified the evil minds of the false gurus. In this way, the people of all these regions became His bhaktas, and began to worship Him. Shree Sahajanand Swami sent His bhaktas into samadhi in order to show them His powers and increase their gnan. Some bhaktas saw Shree Krishna Bhagvan giving darshan to Lakshmi, Radhika, Shreedama, and other parshads, in Golok. Some bhaktas saw Vishnu giving darshan to Lakshmi, Nand, Sunand, and other parshads in Vaikunth. Some bhaktas saw Maha-Purush giving darshan to the niranna-muktas in Shvet-Dvip. Some bhaktas saw Bhuma-Purush giving darshan to Lakshmi and many parshads in Avyakrut. Some bhaktas saw Nar-Narayan giving darshan to the rushis in Badrikashram. Some bhaktas saw Shesh-Shayi-Narayan giving darshan to the bhaktas in Kshir-Sagar. Some bhaktas saw Hiranyamay-Purush giving darshan to Surya-Dev and his servants. Some bhaktas saw Yagna-Purush giving darshan to Agni-Dev and his servants. Some bhaktas heard the sound of pranav. Some bhaktas saw light equal to millions of suns. Some bhaktas saw Brahm, which is sachidanand, and beyond jagrat, svapna, sushupti. Some bhaktas saw Virat-Purush, who is the supporter of the brahmand. Some bhaktas saw the loks and powers of the devs. Some bhaktas saw the six chakras and their presiding devs, such as Ganesh. Sahajanand Swami also gave darshan to His bhaktas who were hundreds of miles away, and accepted the food that they had offered in their homes, which showed His greatness. He gave darshan to bhaktas who were going to Akshardham, and all the people in their village, even if they were not bhaktas. He also revealed His alokik powers to both bhaktas and kusangis everywhere. As the people were amazed by His divine grace, they abandoned their own gurus and sampradays and joined satsang. People from many sampradays came to meet Sahajanand Swami with the intention of defeating Him in a philosophical debate. However, after realising His greatness, they became humble before Him, and said, "Maharaj. You are the avatar of Bhagvan. Kindly give us your darshan, so that we can see the devs who we worship" . On hearing this, Sahajanand Swami sat them down and sent them into samadhi. This caused their nadis and prans to stop, and their jeevs left their bodies, leaving the bodies lifeless. They all then saw their ishtha-devs in Sahajanand Swami. The Vaishnavs and the followers of Madhvi and Nimbark saw Sahajanand Swami in the svarup of Shree Krishna surrounded by gopis in Vrundavan. The followers of Ramanuj saw Lakshmi- Narayan, surrounded by parshads, such as Nand, Sunand, Vishvaksen, and Garud. The bhaktas of Shree Ram saw Him seated on a sinhasan, surrounded by Sitaji, Lakshmanji, and Hanumanji. The followers of Shankar-acharya saw light, and the followers of Shiv saw Shiv with Parvati and Ganesh. The followers of Surya-Dev saw Surya-Dev and Hiranmay-Purush. The followers of Ganesh saw Maha-Ganpati. The followers of devis saw a devi. The Jains saw Tirthankar, and the Muslims saw Paigambar. In this way, they all saw their own ishta-dev in Sahajanand Swami due to samadhi, and realised that He was the cause of all the avatars. So, they all abandoned their sampradays and became followers of Sahajanand Swami. Sahajanand Swami removed the darkness of ignorance by his extraordinary powers, and established the ekantik dharma which had been completely destroyed on the earth. He set up alms-houses with the wealth of His rich grahastha bhaktas, and distributed free food. Also, He performed many yagnas, such as Vishnu-Yag, Maha-Rudra and Ati-Rudra, without the sacrifice of animals. During these yagnas, He served rich foods, and gave alms to thousand of brahmans. He performed many pujas of sadhu, brahmans, and devs, and served rich foods. Sahajanand Swami destroyed adharma and hypocrisy. He had many mandirs built in different regions, and installed the various murtis, such as Nar-Narayan, Lakshmi-Narayan, Bhakti-Dharma, Hari- Krishna, and Radha-Krishna. He displayed miracles through these murtis. Wherever He went, He taught people about the dharma of their varna and ashram, gnan of the atma and Bhagvan's svarup, vairagya, and bhakti coupled with Bhagvan's greatness. Sahajanand Swami gave bliss and joys to His bhaktas at all times. Sahajanand Swami mainly stayed in Gadhada as He was attached to the bhakti of Abhay Raja and his son and daughters, who had all dedicated their lives to Sahajanand Swami. He celebrated Janamashtmi, Ramnavmi, Prabodhini Ekadashi, Holi, and Annkut festivals by serving rich foods. The paramhans, brahm-charis, and bhaktas of different places came to these festivals and offered gifts to Sahajanand Swami, such as rich clothes, jewellery, flowers, and sandalwood. Sahajanand Swami served them rich food and pleased the brahmans and sadhus. The Tils and Chihns Of Sahajanand Swami On the soles of the feet of Sahajanand Swami, there are urdhva- rekha (lines). These lines start between the first two toes. They are also found on the heels. On the sole of the right foot there is the chihn of a jav on the big toe.

The murti of Shreeji Maharaj is beautiful, pleasant, strong, and charming. The murti is such that it attracts the minds and eyes of the bhaktas who perform His darshan. The murti is the colour of newly formed clouds, peaceful, and the same height as the murti of Shree Gopinathji in Gadhada. The body of Sahajanand Swami is like the description in all the shastras, but the chihns and tils have been described from memory.

Daily Routine Of Shree Hari
Sahajanand Swami wakes up when there are three or four ghadis (72 to 96 minutes) remaining of the night, and brushes His teeth. After bathing, He wipes His body with a clean, thin piece of cloth. He then stands up and holds the wet cloth, that He was wearing, between His two thighs and twists it with both His hands to squeeze the water out. He then wipes and dries His thighs and legs, and puts on a clean, thin, white dhoti and keeps it very tight. He covers His upper body with another clean, thin, white piece of cloth. He prefers to wear white clothes. Then, after completing His morning puja, He wears His chakhadis and goes for breakfast. Shreeji Maharaj takes His seat. He covers His head with a cloth, which He tucks it behind His ears. While eating, He faces north or east. He raises His right knee, and rests His right elbow on the knee. He has the habit of drinking water while He eats. If He finds a tasty item of food, He offers some to His best bhaktas. He also has the habit of moving His hand on the belly after belching. Sometimes, when He is pleased with a bhakta, He offers His prasad. When He wants to serve food to the sadhus, He keeps His khes on His left shoulder, and ties the ends around His waist. While serving, He repeatedly calls the names of the different foods and moves up and down the rows of the sadhus. He has great faith, respect, and happiness in feeding and serving food. In Gadhada, during the seasons of Varsha and Sharad, when He learns that the water of the River Ghela has become clear, He goes there to bathe with the sadhus and satsangis. Then, while praising the waters of the river and delighting the bhaktas, He plays with the bhaktas. When He dives into the water, He presses His ears, eyes, and nose with His thumbs and fingers. After diving into the water, He comes up to the surface after a long time. He gargles with water, and moves His right hand around His face. Sometimes, He stands in the middle of the river, and makes the sadhus sing kirtans while clapping, and also joins them in singing and clapping. While entering the water for bathing or while coming out after bathing, He holds the hands of His bhaktas. When He sees the happy faces of the bhaktas that have performed His darshan, He comes out of the water and stands on the river bank. He wears a dry, thin, white dhoti and keeps it very tight. He then squeezes the water from the wet dhoti He was wearing before. Then, He ties a white feto on His head, with the cloth very close to His eyebrow, and keep a chhoglu hanging out of the top. He also puts a khes on His left shoulder, and ties the ends around His waist. Finally, He rides a beautiful horse, and returns to His residence while pleasing the eyes of thousands of surrounding bhaktas. While walking, Shreeji Maharaj moves His right arm; and sometimes holds a handkerchief in His right hand and places His left hand on His left hip. Sometimes, He places a thin, white cloth over His shoulder, and sometimes He puts a khes on His left shoulder, and ties the ends around His waist. He has the nature of walking very fast. He walks so fast that the bhaktas following Him are hardly able to keep pace with Him, and have to run to keep pace with Him. When He walks while wearing chakhadis, the chakhadis make a knocking sound on the ground. While standing when performing a task or while walking slowly, He has the habit of gently hitting His right thigh with His right fist. Sometimes, when there is a great crowd of people, and there is a lot of dust flying around, He covers His nose and His face with a handkerchief. Sometimes, He sits on a decorated cot; sometimes He sits on a thin mattress covered with a bed sheet; sometimes, He sits on a thick cushioned seat; sometimes He sits on a square cushion; and sometimes He sits on a large, cylindrical pillow. Sometimes, He sits with His legs crossed, and sometimes He sits with His legs bent and tied with a cloth. Sometimes when He sits, He supports His back with a pillow, and has the habit of sitting with His legs stretched forward, with one leg crossed over the other. Sometimes, He moves a finger of His right hand along the urdhva-rekha of His left foot. Sometimes, He keeps His tongue pressed between His teeth on one side. While sitting, He twists His neck on both the sides and makes a cracking sound. Sometimes, He lies with a pillow under His chest, and has His back pressed by the bhaktas. Shreeji Maharaj turns a mala of tulsi beads wherever He sits; sometimes He playfully moves two beads at the same time; and sometimes He folds up the mala and rubs it between His two palms; and when He has no mala in the hand, and He counts the segments on the fingers. Sometimes, He closes His eyes and performs dhyan; sometimes He performs dhyan with His eyes open; and sometimes He suddenly awakens from dhyan. Sometimes, He performs dhyan while the sadhus sing kirtans to the accompaniment of musical instruments. Sometimes, He joins the sadhus in singing, while snapping His fingers; nd sometimes when the sadhus sing kirtans while clapping, He joins them in singing while clapping. Sometimes, when the sadhus sing kirtans to the accompaniment of musical instruments, or the sadhus are reading katha before Him, or He is giving a spiritual talk, He gradually moves closer to them. During the katha, He repeatedly says the word "Hare" . When He is carrying out some activity, and He recalls a talk from a katha, He says "Hare" and then when He realises that He is not listening to a katha, He gently smiles at the bhaktas near Him. Sometimes, if He is happily talking, or is listening to a katha, or is listening to kirtans, or is engrossed in some thought, and then someone comes and calls Him for dinner or comes perform His puja, He becomes very annoyed. Sometimes, He sits in the sabha of His bhaktas and delivers talks about dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti, and sometimes He explains the essence of Yog, Sankhya, Panch Ratra, Vedant, and other shastras. Sometimes, He raises both His hands and claps to silence the bhaktas and begins His talks. Sometimes, when there may be a very large sabha of bhaktas and He wishes to delivers a talk, He stands up so that He may be heard from a distance, and raises both His hands and claps to silence the bhaktas. Sometimes, He is so engrossed in the talk, that He does not notice when His upper garment is slipping. This is His nature. Sometimes, in a sabha, Shreeji Maharaj asks the sadhus and haribhaktas to begin a question and answer session. Then, if someone asks a difficult question and if no one able to answer it, He gives the reply to the delight of all. Sometimes, while delivering a talk, He crushes a bunch of flowers or a large flower with His hands. Sometimes, while delivering a talk He has the habit of twisting the end of His handkerchief. He accepts the puja that is lovingly offered by bhaktas who have come from other regions to celebrate festivals. Sometimes, when the bhaktas come in large groups to perform His puja, He accepts their garlands with both His hands, or with His legs, or even with His stick. Sometimes, His darshan sends a person into samadhi, and sometimes He awakens them from samadhi immediately. Sometimes, when He wishes to call someone in a sabha, He makes a signal with His eyes, or He points at them with His index finger. Sometimes, realising the cooling effect of the garlands of mogra, the fruits, like lemons, He repeatedly brings them near to His eyes. Sometimes, He listens to the katha, and sometimes He narrates the katha, and sometimes He asks for kirtans to be sung, and then sings the kirtans Himself. Shreeji Maharaj does not like to stay idle at any time by keeping away from good activities, such as constructing mandirs, and feeding sadhus and brahmans. He is very fast in completing any work of bhakti and dharma that He undertakes. Whenever He wants to sneeze, He finds His handkerchief and holds it in front of His face, and sneezes so loudly that it is heard even at a distance. He sneezes two or three times. Whenever He yawns, He loudly says "Hare, Hare" while rubbing His eyes. Shreeji Maharaj loves the seva performed by nishkam bhaktas. Sometimes, He playfully laughs loudly, while covering His mouth with His handkerchief. Sometimes, He is so pleased to see bhaktas who have come from other regions, that He stands up and embraces them, and asks about the news of their villages and towns. Sometimes, He happily embraces the sadhus, who have come to celebrate a festival, as they leave for other regions. Sometimes, when He is pleased with His bhaktas, He places His hands on their heads, and places His feet on their chests. Sometimes, when He is extremely pleased with a bhakta, He offers gifts, such as a garland of flowers, or string of flowers, or His clothes and jewellery. He is very generous. He immediately gives a highly valuable item to a good person, the moment He decides to do so, without any delay. Sometimes, He cracks the knuckles of His hands and feet; and sometimes He the bhaktas sitting nearby to crack His knuckles. Sometimes, when He sees or hears of an animal suffering, He has the nature of saying "Ram, Ram" out of compassion. Sometimes, when He sees any person suffering, He offers food and clothes to ease this suffering, as He feels great compassion in His heart. Sometimes, if a person is hitting someone, He would not tolerate this, and stops the person by yelling. Sometimes, if someone criticises a sadhu or a bhakta, He feels upset, and then scolds that person and is disrespectful. Sometimes, if He feels physically unwell, He examines the pulse of His right hand, with the fingers of His left hand. When He concludes a sabha, He says "Jay Sachidanand" or "Jay Swaminarayan" . Then, after bowing down to the sadhus. He stands up. Sometimes, while riding a horse and travelling, He stretches one leg on the neck of the horse. When He is going to sleep, He moves His fingers on His forehead as if He is making the tilak mark. He asks for His mala, and turns it in His right hand. While sleeping, He keeps His face open; and if anyone touches Him while He is in deep sleep, He wakes up suddenly, and asks "Who's there?" This description of the nature of Shreeji Maharaj has been written from memory, and there are many more descriptions. He lived in Gadhada and delivered talks on five topics in order to remove the doubts of His bhaktas: svadharma atma-gnan, vairagya, gnan of Bhagvan's svarup, and bhakti coupled with Bhagvan's greatness. These talks, and many talks from Amdavad, Vadtal and many other villages, have been written from memory to the best of our knowledge for the welfare of the bhaktas.

GADHADa I - Shree Gadhada Pratham Prakaran

Gadhada I – 1
Constantly Engaging The Mind On The Svarup Of Bhagvan
1.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the night of Magshar sud 4 [20th November, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj had come to the residential hall of the sadhus, in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sadhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
1.2 Shreeji Maharaj then asked, "What is the most difficult of all spiritual activities?"
1.3 The brahm-charis, sadhus, and grahasthas, answered according to their understanding, but no one could give a satisfactory reply.
1.4 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Allow me to answer. There is no spiritual activity more difficult than to continuously engage the mind on the svarup of Bhagvan. The shastras state that there is no greater achievement for a person whose mind's vrutti is constantly focused on the murti of Bhagvan. This is because the murti of Bhagvan is like a chintamani. Just as a person who possesses a chintamani attains whatever he desires, a person whose mind's vrutti is constantly focused on the murti of Bhagvan can instantly see, if he so wishes, the svarups of jeev, ishvar, Maya, and Brahm. He can also see Vaikunth, Golok, Brahm-Mahol, and other dhams of Bhagvan. Therefore, there is no spiritual activity more difficult, nor is there any greater achievement, than to continuously engage the mind's vrutti on the murti of Bhagvan."
1.5 Then, Sheth Govardhan-Bhai asked Shreeji Maharaj, "What is the nature of Bhagvan's maya?"
1.6 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Maya is anything that obstructs a bhakta of Bhagvan, while he is performing dhyan of Bhagvan's murti."
1.7 Then, Muktanand Swami enquired, "When a bhakta leaves his physical body, which is composed of the five bhuts, and goes to Akshardham, what type of body does he attain?"
1.8 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "A bhakta who has sought refuge in the Dharma-Kul will attain a brahmay body by the wish of Bhagvan. When such bhaktas leave their body and go to Akshardham, some go by sitting on Garud, some go by sitting on a rath, and others go by sitting on a viman. This is how they reach the dham of Bhagvan. Those who have mastered yog-samadhi, can actually witness these events."
1.9 Then, Harji Thakkar asked Shreeji Maharaj, "Some have been practising satsang for quite some time, yet they do not have the intense love for satsang as they do for their own body and their relatives. What is the reason for this?"
1.10 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "Such a person has not fully realised the greatness of Bhagvan. When a sant, by whose association the greatness of Bhagvan can be fully realised, talks to him about his svabhav, the person is not able to change his behaviour. Instead, he develops hatred towards the sant that has advised him. It is due to this sinful act that he does not develop intense love for satsang. After all, sins committed elsewhere, are washed away by association with a sant. But sins committed against a sant, are washed away only by the grace of the sant himself, not by any other means. The shastras also state: anya-kshetre krutam papam tirth-kshetre vina-shyati| tirth-kshetre krutam papam vajra-lepo bhavi-shyati|| Sins committed elsewhere are destroyed at a place of pilgrimage, but sins committed at a place of pilgrimage are as though etched in iron.
1.11 "Therefore, if a person does not have hatred towards the sant, he develops intense love for satsang."

Uttam, Madhyam, And Kanishth Levels Of Vairagya
2.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the night of Magshar sud 5 [21st November, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj had come to the residential hall of the sadhus, in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sadhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
2.2 Then, Mayaram Bhatt asked Shreeji Maharaj, "Maharaj, please describe the characteristics of the three levels of vairagya – uttam, madhyam, and kanishth."
2.3 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "A person who has the uttam vairagya, engages in worldly activities, either by the agna of Bhagvan, or as a result of his responsibilities; but like Janak Raja, he is not affected by those worldly activities. He may indulge in the most tempting of the five vishays ( shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh) attained as a consequence of his responsibilities, but he does so unwillingly. Those vishays are unable to attract him, so his tyag remains undiminished. He invariably views those vishays as flawed, and treats them like enemies. Moreover, he constantly remains in contact with sadhus, and shastras, and remains in the seva of Bhagvan. Even if he were to come across difficult desh, kal, and sang, his understanding would not weaken. Such a person is said to possess uttam vairagya.
2.4 "A person who has madhyam vairagya, also indulges in the most appealing of the five vishays and remains unattached to them. However, if he were to encounter difficult desh, kal, and sang, he would become attached to those vishays, causing his vairagya to decline. Such a person is said to possess madhyam vairagya.
2.5 "As for a person who has kanishth vairagya, if he were to encounter ordinary or inferior vishays, he may indulge in them, but would not become bound by them. However, if he were to encounter and indulge in appealing vishays, he would become bound by them. Such a person is said to possess kanishth vairagya."

Gadhada I – 3
Remembering The Leelas Of Bhagvan
3.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the night of Magshar sud 6 [22nd November, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
3.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Even a person who can constantly see the murti of Bhagvan in his heart, should recall the leelas performed by Bhagvan in His different avatars in different places. He should also maintain love for brahm-charis, sadhus and satsangis, and should always remember them. If at the time of death he forgets the murti of Bhagvan, but remembers the leelas performed by Him in the different places, or if he remembers satsangis, brahm-charis or sadhus, then he will also remember the murti of Bhagvan. In this way, that person attains a high spiritual status and benefits greatly. That is why I perform grand Vishnu- yags, annually celebrate Janamashtmi, Ekadashi, and other festivals, and gather brahm-charis, sadhus and satsangis on these occasions. Even a sinner who remembers these occasions at the time of death, can attain Akshardham."

Gadhada I – 4
Jealousy Like That Of Naradji
4.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Magshar sud 7 [23rd November, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sadhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
4.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Haribhaktas should not have jealousy amongst each other."
4.3 anandanand Swami replied, "Maharaj, even then jealousy still remains."
4.4 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj explained "If a person does hold jealousy within them, it should be like that of Naradji. Once, both Naradji and Tumbru went to Vaikunth for the darshan of Lakshmi-Narayan. There, Tumbru sang before them. Both Lakshmiji and Narayan were so pleased that they rewarded him with their clothes and jewellery. Seeing this Naradji became jealous of Tumbru, and thought, 'I shall also learn to sing like Tumbru, so I can please Bhagvan'.
4.5 "Naradji learned the art of singing, and sang before Bhagvan. But Bhagvan replied, 'You do not know how to sing like Tumbru'. Then, Naradji performed tap to please Shiv, and received his blessings to master the art of singing. However, when he sang again, Bhagvan still was not pleased with his singing. So he practised his singing for seven manvantars. Despite this, Bhagvan still was not pleased.
4.6 "Finally, Naradji learned to sing from Tumbru himself, and then sang before Shree Krishna Bhagvan in Dvarika. Only then was Shree Krishna pleased, and rewarded Naradji with His clothes and jewellery. Naradji then abandoned his jealousy towards Tumbru.
4.7 "Therefore, if a person is to hold jealousy within themselves, then he should perceive the gun of the person that he is jealous of. He should also abandon his own avgun. If this cannot be done, then a bhakta should at least totally abandon any form of jealousy that would result in harming another bhakta."

Gadhada I – 5
Persistency In Dhyan
5.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Magshar sud 8 [24th November, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
5.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A person should perform dhyan upon Shree Krishna Bhagvan together with Radhikaji. If he cannot hold the murti within the heart whilst performing dhyan, he should not lose faith and stop the dhyan like a coward. Those who are persistent in this way will earn the immense grace and darshan of Bhagvan. Moreover, Bhagvan will be bound by their bhakti."

Gadhada I – 6
A Person With Wisdom And A Person Without Wisdom
6.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Magshar sud 9, [25th November, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
6.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "In satsang, a person who is wise, increasingly finds avgun within himself, and perceives gun in Bhagvan and His bhakta. Moreover, when Bhagvan and His sant utter harsh words of advice for his own benefit, he accepts them as beneficial, and is not hurt by them. Such a person steadily attains greatness in satsang.
6.3 "Conversely, a person who lacks wisdom, practices satsang and listens to talk about satsang, but continually perceives gun within himself. When Bhagvan and His sant highlight his avgun and advise him, he misinterprets such advice due to his arrogance. He perceives avgun in the person advising him. Such a person steadily declines, and loses his reputation in satsang. Therefore, if a person abandons the pride of his own gun, and remains brave, and keeps faith in Bhagvan and His sant, his ignorance is eradicated, and he attains greatness in satsang."

Gadhada I – 7
Anvay And Vyatirek
7.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Magshar sud 9 [26th November, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
7.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "No one is able to understand the philosophical principles found in the shastras. In fact, all are confused by them. Therefore, please listen as I explain those principles precisely as they are.
7.3 "When the jeev behaves as if united with the three bodies of sthul, sukshma, and karan, it is known as the anvay form of the jeev. When the jeev is distinct from these three bodies and described as eternal, it is known as the vyatirek form of the jeev.
7.4 "Ishvar, when together with its three bodies of virat, sutratma, and avyakrut, is its anvay form. When ishvar is distinct from these three bodies and is described as eternal, it is known as the vyatirek form of ishvar.
7.5 "When Akshar- Brahm pervades Maya and the countless millions of brahmands that evolve from Maya, it is said to be in its anvay form. When Maya is distinct from everything and has the attributes of sachidanand, it is known as the vyatirek form of the Maya.
7.6 "When Shree Krishna Bhagvan is the antaryami and the controller of Akshar-Brahm, the ishvars, the jeevs, Maya and the brahmands that evolve from Maya, it is said to be the anvay form of Bhagvan. When He is distinct from all and resides amidst the light of Brahm in Golok, it is said to be the vyatirek form of Bhagvan.
7.7 "These five entities – Purushottam Bhagvan, Akshar-Brahm, Maya, ishvar, and jeev – are eternal."

Engaging The Indriyas In The Seva Of Bhagvan And His Sant
8.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Magshar sud 11 [27th November, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sadhu s, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
8.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "If the indriyas are engaged in the seva of Shree Krishna Bhagvan and His bhakta, then the antah-karans are purified and the sins, which have been attached to the jeev for eternity, are destroyed. On the other hand, if the vrutti s of the indriyas are directed towards women and other vishays, then a person's antah-karans become polluted and he falls from the path of kalyan.
8.3 "Therefore, a person should indulge in the vishays only as prescribed in the shastras, but should never indulge in them by disobeying the niyams that are described in the shastras. Also, a person should keep the company of a sant and should avoid kusang. In this way, when a person avoids kusang and keeps the company of a sant, the sense of 'I-ness' that he has towards his body and the sense of 'my-ness' that he has towards his bodily relations, are destroyed. He also develops profound love for Bhagvan, and vairagya towards everything except Bhagvan."
8.4 Then, on that same day, three hours after sunrise, Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in Dada Khachar's darbar, facing the neem tree. A sabha of paramhans was seated underneath the neem tree. Grahastha satsangis were also seated in the sabha. Sankhya-yogi and female bhaktas were also seated in the sabha.
8.5 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Paramhans. Talk about your strengths in satsang; and if there is a weakness, then do no talk about it. Only talk about the strengths. Whoever has firm nishchay in Bhagvan, should talk about that; and whoever has great knowledge about the atma, should talk about that – 'I am not a body; I am an atma'. Also, those who have the strength of one of the five qualities – nirlobhi, or nishkami, or nispruhi, or nisvadi, or nirmani – talk about your strength."
8.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj happily said, "First, I will talk about my strength. Then, you will talk about your strength."
8.7 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "By the grace of Nar-Narayan, I know I am an atma, I am achhedhya, I am abhedhya, and I am sachidanand. My greatness is due to the strength of my own svarup, and upasana of Nar-Narayan; it is not due to expensive clothes, valuable jewellery, chariots, palkhi, elephants, and horses. Also, my greatness is not due to all the satsangi men and kings in the world standing before me with folded hands. If they were to leave satsang and become vimukhs, and if I do not have clothes to wear or a place to live, I will not feel inferior. My upasana of Nar-Narayan is the cause of my greatness, and it is the reason that I know 'I am brahm', and how I know 'I am an atma'. If I try to leave my greatness, or if other devs try to reduce my greatness, it still will not diminish.
8.8 "My upasana of the Nar-Narayan, who is Parbrahm and Paramatma, is such that 'This Bhagvan has a sakar murti'. If someone speaks of their experiences, or uses shastras to convince me that Bhagvan is nirakar, I will never trust their talks. This is because, due to His grace, I can see the sakar svarup of Bhagvan in front of me.
8.9 "In my heart, I understand that those who say Bhagvan is nirakar, have not fully understood Him, have never had darshan of His svarup, and they do not understand the shastras. In the shastras, those who have written that Bhagvan has a nirakar svarup, have written this to show that Bhagvan's svarup is not like our mayik svarup. In Bhagvan's physical body, the features that can be destroyed – five bhuts, ten indriyas, four antah-karans – are not like those found in humans. It is for this reason that the shastras have described Bhagvan as nirakar.
8.10 "The indriyas that are in Bhagvan's body cannot be destroyed. With his eyes, he looks towards Purush, who then looks towards Maya. This causes millions of universes to evolve from Maya. In these universes, the devs evolve, and in each universe, the sthavar and jangam objects form. This proves that Bhagvan has eyes.
8.11 "Then, when the universe and all the sthavar and jangam objects are destroyed, and maha-pralay occurs, only Bhagvan remains. The Veds then pray to Bhagvan. Listening to these prayers, he creates the universe again. This proves that Bhagvan has ears.
8.12 "In this way, there are fourteen indriyas, which are alokik and cannot be explained.
8.13 "Through physical svarups, such as Ram and Krishna, Bhagvan comes to earth for the kalyan of the jeevs. Due to his extreme compassion, he takes a svarup that can be seen by the jeev. Bhagvan believes that if he does not take a physical svarup that can be seen, then how will the jeev perform dhyan, smaran, and puja? For this reason, Bhagvan takes a pratyaksha svarup that can be seen by all – both satsangis and kusangis.
8.14 "But, Bhagvan is the way He is. His indriyas or body do not become mayik just because the jeev is able to see Him. For this reason, I can never believe anyone who claims that Bhagvan is nirakar.
8.15 "If all the females in the universe come to my seva, and if all the objects in the universe are offered to me, I will not become attached to them. This is due to the strength from my upasana of Nar-Narayan. But, even if I do become attracted to these objects, I am not attached to them. This is due to the grace of my Bhagvan, who allows me to have firm knowledge of my own svarup.
8.16 "I do not know how to give someone a son, give money, make the dead come alive, or kill someone. But, I do know how to give kalyan to a jeev, and take that jeev to Akshardham. I shall not speak anymore. If I do speak, I will end up speaking more than I should."
8.17 Saying all this, Maharaj looked at all the paramhans, with cool eyes like the season of Sharad. He then said, "Now, talk about your own strengths in satsang."
8.18 Maharaj then said, "You and I have the same strengths. Therefore, my strengths are a part of you. Keep firm nishchay in everything I have said today." In this way, Maharaj explained his own strengths in satsang for the benefit of the bhaktas. In reality, He Himself is Purushottam Narayan.

Desire For The Pratyaksha Svarup Of Bhagvan
9.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Magshar sud 12 [28th November, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
9.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Suppose a person has developed nishchay in pratyaksha Shree Krishna Bhagvan, offers bhakti to Him, and has His darshan. But, despite this, he still does not consider himself fulfilled, and instead, feels a deficiency within his antah-karans. He thinks, 'As long as I have not seen the radiant svarup of this very same Bhagvan in Golok, Vaikunth, and other dhams, I have not attained ultimate kalyan'. Talks about Bhagvan should not be heard from a person with such ignorance.
9.3 "If a person has firm nishchay in pratyaksha Bhagvan, believes himself to be fulfilled merely by His darshan and desires nothing else, then Bhagvan Himself forcefully shows him His divine powers and murtis in His dhams.
9.4 "Therefore, a person with firm nishchay in Bhagvan, should desire nothing, except pratyaksha Bhagvan."

The Ungrateful Sevak-Ram
10.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Magshar sud 13 [29th November, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
10.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Once, when I was travelling from Venkatadri to Setubandh Rameshvar, I came across a sadhu by the name of Sevak-Ram. He had studied Shreemad Bhagvat and other Purans. During his journey, he fell ill. With him, he had a thousand rupees worth of gold coins. However, as he had no one to nurse him, he began to cry. I consoled him, and said, 'Do not worry about anything. I shall look after you'.
10.3 "On the outskirts of the village, there was a banana orchard, where there was a banyan tree that was home to a thousand ghosts. The sadhu had become extremely ill and was unable to walk any further. I felt extreme pity for him. So I prepared a bed of banana leaves one-and-a-half feet high under the banyan tree. As the sadhu was suffering from dysentery and was passing blood, I would wash him and attend to him.
10.4 "He would give me enough of his money to buy sugar, ghee, and grains for himself. I would bring the ingredients, cook them, and then feed him. As for myself, I would go to the village for my meals. On some days, when I did not receive any food from the village, I had to do upvas. Despite this, that sadhu never once said to me, 'I have enough money. Cook for both of us so that you may dine with me'.
10.5 "After serving the sadhu for two months in this way he began to recover. Then, as we walked towards Setubandh Rameshvar, he made me carry his belongings weighing about twenty kilograms, whereas he walked with only a mala in his hand. By then, he was healthy and capable of digesting half a kilogram of ghee, yet he still made me carry his load while he walked empty-handed. In actual fact, my nature was such that I would not keep even a handkerchief with me. But respecting him as a sadhu, I walked carrying his belongings weighing twenty kilograms.
10.6 "Although I served that sadhu and helped him recover, he did not offer me even a single penny worth of food. Therefore, realising him to be ungrateful, I abandoned his company. In this way, a person who does not appreciate favours done by others should be known as a krutaghni.
10.7 "In addition, if a person has committed a sin but has performed the prayshchit for it as written in the shastras, then whoever still considers him a sinner should himself be considered a sinner, just like a krutaghni. "

Vasna And Ekantik Bhakta
11.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Magshar sud 14 [30th November, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
11.2 Then, Brahmanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, what is the nature of vasna?"
11.3 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "A desire within the antah-karans to enjoy vishays that have been previously seen, heard, or encountered, is called vasna. Moreover, a desire within the antah-karans to enjoy vishays that have not previously been encountered, is also called vasna."
11.4 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, who can we call an ekantik bhakta of Bhagvan?"
11.5 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person who has no vasna other than Bhagvan, and who thinks himself to be brahm-rup as he offers bhakti to Bhagvan, is known as an ekantik bhakta."

Creation And Destruction
12.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Magshar sud Punam [1st December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of s a dhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
12.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "When a person understands the nature of the causes of the entire creation, specifically Purush, Prakruti, Kal, and the twenty-four tattvas, including maha-tattva, then he is released from the bondage of his avidya, and the twenty-four tattvas that evolve from avidya."
12.3 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, how can their nature be known?"
12.4 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Their nature can be realised by knowing their characteristics. I shall now describe those characteristics.
12.5 "Purush is the controller of Prakruti, and is also distinct from her. He is indivisible, without a beginning, and without an end. He is self-luminous, omniscient, imperishable, satya, kshetragna, and the cause of all the activities that possess a form. Also, he has a divya body.
12.6 "Prakruti is composed of the three gun. She is both jad and chaitanya, eternal, nirvishesh, the kshetra of all the jeevs and all the elements, including maha-tattva. She is also the divine power of Bhagvan.
12.7 "Maya is nirvishesh, and the three gun of Maya are normally in the state of equilibrium. That which disturbs Maya, is called Kal.
12.8 "Now I shall describe the characteristics of maha-tattva and the other elements, so please listen.
12.9 "Chitt and maha-tattva should not be regarded as being different. The entire world resides in a small form within maha-tattva, which itself is unchanging, luminous, pure, peaceful, and full of pure sattva-gun.
12.10 "Ahankar is composed of the three gun, and is the cause of the evolution of all bhuts, indriyas, antah-karans, their presiding devs, and the prans. It is peaceful, dense, and totally ignorant.
12.11 "The man is the place where all the desires for women and other objects are generated. It is subject to random thoughts, and is the controller of all the indriyas.
12.12 "Buddhi possesses the knowledge of all the objects. The specific knowledge which all the indriyas possess, is due to the buddhi. Its natural features are sanshay, nishchay, nindra, and smruti.
12.13 "The characteristics of the ten indriyas – the ears ( shrotra), the skin ( tvak), the eyes ( chakshu), the tongue ( rasna), the nose ( ghran), the voice ( vak), the hands ( pani), the feet ( pad), the anus ( payu), and the genitals ( upastha) – is to connect themselves in their respective vishays.
12.14 "Shabda is the indicator of all objects. Shabda is the cause of all social interactions, and reveals the nature and class of the speaker. It dwells within akash, and is also the physical element of akash, and is perceived by the ears.
12.15 "Sparsh is the physical element of vayu. Softness, hardness, cold, heat, and perception by the skin, are the characteristics of sparsh.
12.16 "Rup reveals the appearance of all objects. It resides in all objects in a small form, and changes as objects change. It is the physical element of tej, and is perceived by the eyes.
12.17 "The characteristics of ras are sweetness, spiciness, distastefulness, bitterness, sourness, and saltiness. It is the physical element of jal, and is perceived by the tongue.
12.18 "The characteristics of gandh are fragrance and stench. It is the physical element of pruthvi, and is perceived by the nose.
12.19 "Pruthvi supports all jeevs, and in the form of a physical body, the pruthvi is their home. It separates the other four bhuts, and gives a physical form to all life-forms.
12.20 "Jal binds pruthvi and other substances, and it also softens and moistens all objects. It satisfies and sustains all life-forms, it quenches thirst, and suppresses heat.
12.21 "Tej is luminosity, the cause of the digestion of food and absorbs liquids. It eliminates cold, is the cause of drying, creates hunger and thirst, and is the cause of burning wood and ghee.
12.22 "Vayu causes trees to shake, and it gathers leaves and other small objects. It also carries the five vishays – shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh – to their indriyas. It is the vital force of all the indriyas.
12.23 "akash provides space for all jeevs, and is the cause of the internal and external activities of the bodies. It is also where the prans, indriyas, and antah-karans reside.
12.24 "In this way, by knowing the characteristics of the twenty-four tattvas, Prakruti, Purush, and Kal, a person is freed from ignorance. In addition to knowing the characteristics, a person should also know the process of their creation.
12.25 "While residing in His dham, Shree Krishna Bhagvan impregnates the womb of Maya through Akshar-Purush, through whom countless millions of Pradhan and Purush are produced. What are those Pradhan- Purush pairs like? Well, they are the cause of the creation of countless millions of brahmands. Of these, I shall now tell you about one Pradhan- Purush pair – the cause of the creation of one brahmand.
12.26 "Firstly, Purushottam Shree Krishna Bhagvan, in the form of Purush, impregnated the womb of Pradhan. From the Pradhan, maha-tattva evolved. From maha-tattva, the three types of ahankar evolved. Of these, from sattvik- ahankar, the man and the presiding devs of the indriyas evolved; from rajas-ahankar, the ten indriyas, the buddhi, and the prans evolved; and from tamas- ahankar, the five bhuts and the five tanmatras evolved. These tattvas were created in this way.
12.27 "Then, inspired by the will of Bhagvan, each tattva with its own components, helped create the bodies of the ishvars and the jeevs. A particular ishvar's bodies are known as virat, sutratma, and avyakrut. A particular jeev's bodies are known as sthul, sukshma, and karan.
12.28 "The body of ishvar, called virat, has a lifespan of two parardhs. Fourteen manvantars pass, during one of Virat- Purush's days, and his night is the same duration as the day. During his day, the lower ten loks of the brahmand remain in existence; and after his night falls, they are destroyed. This is called nimit- pralay.
12.29 "When the two parardhs of Virat- Purush have passed, the body of Virat is destroyed, along with Satya-Lok and the other loks. At that time, Pradhan- Prakruti, Purush, and the twenty-four tattvas, including maha-tattva, are absorbed back onto Maha-Maya. This is called prakrut- pralay.
12.30 "When that Maha-Maya is absorbed by the divine light of Akshar-Brahm – like the night merges into the day – it is called atyantik-pralay. Also, the day-to-day death of the bodies of individual devs, demons, and humans, is called nitya-pralay.
12.31 "In this way, by knowing the process of the creation, sustenance, and destruction, a person develops vairagya towards the world, and bhakti towards Bhagvan. Also, when all of those brahmands are destroyed, all other jeevs lie dormant within Maya, whereas the bhaktas of Bhagvan attain the dham of Bhagvan."
12.32 Again Muktanand Swami enquired, "What is the dham of Bhagvan like?"
12.33 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The dham of Bhagvan is without a beginning and without an end. It is infinite, indivisible, divya and sachidanand. I shall describe it using an analogy.
12.34 "Imagine that this whole world, with all the mountains, trees, humans, animals, and all other life-forms, is made of glass. Also, imagine that all the stars in the sky are as bright as the sun. Then, just as the glass world would glow with extreme beauty amidst this radiance, the dham of Bhagvan is similarly beautiful. Bhaktas of Bhagvan see this in samadhi and attain that luminous dham after death."

How Many Jeevs Are Within Each Body?
13.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Magshar vad 1 [2nd December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead under the neem tree near the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan, in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a red surval and a red dagli. He had tied a golden shelu around His head, and another golden shelu was tied around His waist. Pearl necklaces hung around His neck, and tassels of pearls were dangling from His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
13.2 Then, Nityanand Swami asked, "Within each body, is there only one jeev, or many? If you say there is only one jeev, then when the branches of a banyan, a pipal, or other trees are cut and planted elsewhere, exactly the same type of trees grows there as well. Has that one jeev been dissected into two, or has another jeev entered the new tree? If you say it is the same jeev, then how has a jeev been divided? A jeev is said to be whole and indivisible."
13.3 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I shall answer the question. Purush and Prakruti are the two powers of Shree Krishna Bhagvan. He is the cause of the creation, sustenance, and destruction of this universe. Through His two powers of Purush and Prakruti, He assumed the form of Virat. Then, during the first brahm- kalp, Bhagvan gave all beings, from Brahma to the smallest blade of grass their bodies, through His own body in the form of Virat.
13.4 "Then, during the padma-kalp, Bhagvan gave Marichi and others their respective bodies, through the form of Brahma. Then, through Kashyap and Daksh, He gave the devs, demons, humans, animals, and all the sthavar and jangam life-forms, their bodies. That Shree Krishna Bhagvan, along with His powers in the form of Purush and Prakruti, resides as antaryami in all jeevs, and grants each jeev a body according to its past karmas.
13.5 "That jeev, in its past lives, has performed many karmas – some with sattva-gun predominating, some with rajo-gun predominating, and some with tamo-gun predominating. As a consequence of those karmas, Bhagvan grants that jeev a body of the udbhij type, or the jarayuj type, or the svedaj type, or the andaj type. Bhagvan also grants the jeev the rewards of its karmas in the form of happiness and misery.
13.6 "In addition, Bhagvan makes the body of that jeev give birth to another body, according to its own karma s. Just as Bhagvan created various life-forms from the bodies of Kashyap and the prajapatis, that same Bhagvan, while residing in all jeevs as antaryami, creates other bodies from one body by methods appropriate to that particular body. However, the jeev, through which other bodies are created, does not itself multiply into many forms. Bhagvan grants birth to a jeev, through the body of another jeev, according to the relation of the karma s between the two jeevs."

Grahastha And Sant Qualities Of A Das Of Bhagvan
14.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Magshar vad 2, [3rd December, 1819], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead under the neem tree opposite the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan, facing south, in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He had tied a white pagh around His head. He was also wearing a white khes, and had covered Himself with a chadar. Also, tassels of yellow flowers decorated His pagh. Bunches of yellow flowers had been placed above both of His ears, with roses decorating those bunches. He was wearing garlands of yellow flowers around His neck. With His right hand, He was playing with a white sevati flower. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
14.2 Shreeji Maharaj then asked the munis, "Suppose there are two bhaktas of Bhagvan. One is a tyagi, and has abandoned worldly life. Although he does not have intense vairagya, he physically abides by the vartmans thoroughly. However, he still has a slight desire for worldly life in his mind, but he overcomes this by a thought process. He also has firm nishchay in Bhagvan. Such is the tyagi. In contrast, there is another bhakta, a grahastha. He also has firm nishchay in Bhagvan. Even though he has remained a grahastha by Bhagvan's agna, he is disinterested in worldly life. He has the same intensity of worldly desires as the tyagi. Of these two bhaktas of Bhagvan, who is better?"
14.3 Muktanand Swami replied, "The tyagi bhakta is better."
14.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The tyagi abandoned worldly of his own accord, out of frustration – so how can he be better? On the other hand, the grahastha has stayed at home because of Bhagvan's agna – so how can he be inferior?"
14.5 Muktanand Swami attempted to answer Shreeji Maharaj's question in many ways, but was unable to give a satisfactory response. Then, he said, "Maharaj, please answer the question yourself."
14.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "If a tyagi who is weak-minded receives rich foods to eat, then desires for worldly life will be revived within his heart. Or, if he encounters many hardships, the desires for worldly life will be revived. Compared to such a tyagi, a grahastha is much better, because whenever a grahastha encounters times of extreme hardship or even times of great pleasure, he is always cautious, just in case he becomes attached to these pleasures. With this awareness, he remains disinterested in worldly life. Therefore, a true tyagi is a person who has no desires for worldly life after he has abandoned it.
14.7 "But keep in mind that a grahastha is much better than a tyagi with worldly desires, only if he follows the dharma prescribed for grahasthas. The grahastha's dharma is extremely difficult to follow because countless occasions of good and bad times are encountered. Despite this, a true grahastha's mind does not waver from serving sant or from following his dharma. He also realises 'The profound association of the sant that I have attained is like a magnificent chintamani and a kalp-vruksh. My wealth, property, sons, and daughters, are merely like a dream. The deep association of the sant that I have attained is the only true benefit of life'. Moreover, he does not become disheartened amidst any type of hardship that may come his way. Such a grahastha is by far the better of the two. Therefore, of all things, becoming a bhakta of Bhagvan is very difficult; and to attain the association of the bhaktas of Bhagvan is very rare indeed."
14.8 Having spoken in this way, Shreeji Maharaj then arranged for the singing of kirtans written by Muktanand Swami.
14.9 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "The Shrutis state: ante ya matihi sa gatihi : Whatever a person's mental state is like at the time of his death, will also be the state of his jeev after his death. "If a person's mind is fixed on Bhagvan at the time of death, he will attain a pleasant fate after death. Otherwise, he will not. This is the interpretation of the Vedic shlok. If this is so, then what is the significance of the bhakti a person has performed throughout his life?"
14.10 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "A person who has been graced with pratyaksha Bhagvan, never falls from the path of kalyan, regardless of whether or not he is conscious and aware of his physical body at the time of death. He is protected by Bhagvan.
14.11 "Conversely, a person who has turned away from Bhagvan, does not attain kalyan when he leaves his physical body, even if he is conscious. Instead, he is sent to Yampuri after death. There are many sinful butchers who die while still fully conscious and aware of their body. Will they attain kalyan? Of course not. If a bhakta of Bhagvan suffers an accidental death and does not remember Bhagvan, he will still attain kalyan.
14.12 "Therefore, that Vedic shlok should be interpreted as follows: 'The outcome at the time of death is determined by the present state of mind'. Therefore, a bhakta who realises in his mind 'My kalyan is guaranteed' will as a result certainly attain kalyan after death. In comparison, a person who has not been graced with the company of a sant or the svarup of Bhagvan, will feel in his mind 'I am ignorant, and I will not attain kalyan'. As a result, his state of mind will determine his fate after death.
14.13 "A person who is the das of Bhagvan has nothing left to do. In fact, other jeevs attain kalyan by his darshan, so what is surprising about him attaining kalyan? But to develop servitude towards Bhagvan is very difficult indeed. This is because a das of Bhagvan has the following characteristics: he realises the physical body as asatya, and his own atma as satya. He has no desires to indulge in objects that are intended for his master. Also, he never behaves against the wishes of his master. Such a person is called a true das of Bhagvan. However, a das of Bhagvan who behaves as the body, is a false bhakta."

Not Becoming Discouraged In Dhyan
15.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Magshar vad 3 [4th December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
15.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "A person whose heart is filled with bhakti towards Bhagvan, feels 'I only want to act according to the agna of Bhagvan and His sant'. This is the spirit within his heart. Also, he never – not even by mistake – utters 'I will only be able to follow certain agna, but not others'.
15.3 "Furthermore, such a person remains determined to see the Bhagvan's murti in his heart. If, while performing dhyan on that murti, it cannot be seen, he does not lose courage. Instead, he constantly maintains a new shraddha. While trying to see that murti, disturbing thoughts may arise, and despite his best efforts, they may not be suppressed. However, these disturbing thoughts can be overcome. The murti of Bhagvan can then be seen within the heart by understanding the immense glory of Bhagvan and by believing himself to be completely fulfilled. Even if this process takes ten years, twenty years, twenty-five years, or even a hundred years, he still does not become discouraged. He never abandon's his attempts at seeing the murti of Bhagvan within his heart. After all, Shree Krishna Bhagvan has mentioned in the Geeta: anek-janma-sansiddh-stato yati param gatim : A yogi who has become siddh after many lives, attains Akshardham.
15.4 "Therefore, a person who continues to try and see Bhagvan in this way, is called an ekantik bhakta."

Wisdom
16.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Magshar vad 4 [5th December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sadhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
16.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A wise bhakta of Bhagvan, who can distinguish between sat and asat, perceives the avgun within himself and thoughtfully eradicates them. He also rejects any apparent avgun he perceives in a sant or a satsangi, and perceives their gun. Moreover, he never sees avgun in Bhagvan. In addition, he accepts as the highest truth, whatever words of advice Bhagvan and a sant offer and does not doubt their words in any way. Therefore, when a sant tells him 'You are distinct from the mind, body, indriyas, and prans; you are satya; you are the knower of the body, indriyas, and prans, which are all asatya' he accepts this to be the truth. He then behaves as the atma – distinct from them all – and never follows the instincts of his own mind.
16.3 "In addition, such a person perceives objects and kusang that may cause bondage, or raise deficiencies in the ekantik dharma, and avoids them. He does not become bound by them. Also, he takes in thoughts that are positive, and avoids thoughts that are negative. A person, who behaves in this way, is known to possess wisdom."

Negative Influence In Satsang, Never Speak Discouraging Words
17.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Magshar vad 5 [6th December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in a west-facing room of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada, while the katha was being read. He was wearing a white khes, and had covered Himself with a chadar. He had tied a white pagh around His head, with a tassel of yellow flowers inserted into the pagh, and He was wearing a garland of yellow flowers. He was in a very pleasant mood.
17.2 At that time, Shreeji Maharaj called for Muktanand Swami, Gopalanand Swami and some other sadhu s. Addressing them, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A small element of negative influence still remains in our satsang, which I wish to eliminate today. I want to conduct this matter in a way that includes all satsangis, paramhans, sankhya-yogis, and karma- yogis.
17.3 "Now, what is this negative influence in satsang? Well, it is those who speak discouragingly about satsang. That is the negative influence in satsang. What do they say? They say, 'Who can follow Bhagvan's agna thoroughly? Who can possibly follow the vartmans perfectly? No one. Therefore, we should follow only as much as we can. After all, Bhagvan is adham-udharan, and so He will grant kalyan to us as well'.
17.4 "They also say, 'Attempting to see Bhagvan's svarup in the heart is not possible by a person's own efforts. It is only seen by those whom Bhagvan helps out of compassion'. With such proud words, they discourage others from practicing dharma, gnan, vairagya, bhakti, and other spiritual activities that please Bhagvan.
17.5 "Therefore, from this day onwards, no one in our satsang should ever utter such discouraging words. Instead, always speak with courage. Those who do speak such words should be known as napunsak. In fact, on days when a person speaks such discouraging words, he should keep an upvas."

Denouncing The Panch- Vishays
18.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Magshar vad 6 [7th December 1819], three hours before sunrise, Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead, in the courtyard in front of the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes.
18.2 After calling the paramhans and satsangis, Shreeji Maharaj sat engrossed in thought for quite some time. Then, He said, "I wish to tell all of you something, so please listen." He then said, "In my mind I feel that I should not talk about this matter. However, I have the understanding that you are all mine, so I shall tell you. The matter is such that only a person who understands it and acts exactly according to it, will become a mukta. Otherwise, even by listening to or studying and understanding the meanings of the four Veds, six shastras, eighteen Purans, and the Mahabharat and other historical shastras, a person cannot become a mukta. I shall now talk about the matter, so please listen.
18.3 "Regardless of the attractive objects which may appear before me, if there is no desire for them in my mind, I am not worried. Also, my nature is such that even if the slightest desire of an object were to arise within me, I only feel at ease after shunning it.
18.4 "For this reason, I thought about what actually causes disturbances within the hearts of Bhagvan's bhaktas. I considered the man, buddhi, chitt, and ahankar as possible causes. However, the antah-karans are not the cause of these disturbances. The only fault of the antah-karans is the satisfaction that it has, due to either the power of its nishchay in Bhagvan or the strength derived from knowledge of the atma. Due to this satisfaction, it feels, 'I have found Bhagvan, and so I have nothing left to do'.
18.5 "Actually, the greater fault lies with the five gnan- indriyas, which I shall now elaborate in detail. Of the many varieties of foods that a person eats, each has differing tastes and differing natural qualities. When he eats that food, the natural qualities of the food pervade and affect the antah-karans as well as the entire body. For example, even a bhakta of Bhagvan, after drinking bhang, loses awareness of his vartmans and the worship of Bhagvan, due to the stimulation caused by that bhang. Similarly, the natural qualities of the countless types of food are of a countless variety, like bhang. So much so, that they seem endless.
18.6 "In the same way, a person also hears a countless variety of sounds with his ears. Those sounds also have a countless variety of natural qualities. Consequently, the qualities of whatever sounds he listens to, pervade and affect his antah-karans. For example, there may be an armed and violent person, an adulterous person, a prostitute, or a person who disobeys the rules of the Veds and society. Listening to the talks of such vicious persons is like drinking bhang or alcohol – such talks pollute the antah-karans of the listener and make him forget the worship of Bhagvan and His vartmans.
18.7 "Similarly, there are countless varieties of touch sensations. They too have countless varieties of natural qualities. The touch of a sinful person also has an effect like that of bhang and alcohol. Therefore, even if a bhakta touched such a person, that bhakta will lose all of his gun.
18.8 "There are also countless varieties of things to see. They too have countless varieties of natural qualities. If a person looks at an immoral person, the effect is just as damaging as drinking bhang or alcohol. Therefore, looking at an immoral person definitely pollutes his mind and causes harm.
18.9 "In the same way, there are countless varieties of smells, with countless varieties of natural qualities. If a person smells the fragrance of a flower or some sandalwood paste from the hands of a sinful person, it pollutes his mind in the same way as drinking bhang.
18.10 "Conversely, just as the mind is polluted by association with an immoral person, association of Bhagvan or His sant purifies the mind. Even if the mind is polluted, it is purified by listening to the words of Bhagvan and His sant. The mind is similarly purified by their touch. However, if a person is unable to touch such a great sant due to the restrictions of his vartmans, then merely touching the dust of his holy feet to his head makes him pure. Likewise, a person is purified by the darshan of a great sant. However, he should have darshan while respecting his vartmans. A person is also purified by eating prasad, but the prasad should be taken in accordance with the niyams of his varna and ashram as set by Bhagvan. If a person is unable to take prasad, he should offer sakar and take that as prasad. In the same way, smelling the fragrance of the flowers and sandalwood paste offered to the great sant also purifies the mind.
18.11 "On the other hand, if a person indulges in the five vishays thoughtlessly, without distinguishing good from bad, then even if he is great as Narad and the Sanakadik, his mind will surely become polluted. What is so surprising about the mind of a person who believes himself to be the body becoming polluted? Therefore, if he gives freedom to the five indriyas without understanding the difference between suitable and unsuitable, his antah-karans will become polluted. On the other hand, if a person indulges only in pure vishays through the five indriyas, then his antah-karans become pure. If the antah-karans become pure, he will be able to constantly remember Bhagvan.
18.12 "However, if the objects of indulgence of even just one of the five indriyas are impure, the antah-karans will also become impure. Therefore, the sole cause of any disturbance experienced by a bhakta of Bhagvan during worship is the vishays of the five indriyas, not the antah-karan.
18.13 "Another factor that determines the nature of a person's antah-karans is the type of company he keeps. If he sits in a sabha of materialistic people in a lavish seven-storey mansion decorated with beautiful mirrors and comfortable seats, and if those materialistic people are seated wearing various types of jewellery and fine clothes, and they are exchanging alcohol amongst themselves, with prostitutes performing vulgar dances to the accompaniment of various musical instruments – then the person's antah-karans will unquestionably be harmfully affected. On the other hand, if a person sits in a sabha where a paramhans is seated on a torn mattress in a grass hut and talks of Bhagvan, dharma, gnan, vairagya and bhakti are in progress – then the person's antah-karans will surely be favourably affected.
18.14 "Therefore, if a person thoughtfully examines the influence of satsang and kusang on the antah-karans, their effects can be realised. However, a fool cannot realise this. Indeed, this fact will not be understood by those who behave irresponsibly like animals. In comparison, a person who has even a little wisdom and has sought at least some refuge in Bhagvan will immediately understand. Therefore, all paramhans, sankhya-yogis and karma- yogis should not associate with evil people.
18.15 "Regardless of how evil a person may be before joining the satsang, he should be accepted into satsang after he takes the appropriate niyams. However, if after joining the satsang, that person retains his evil nature, he or she should be removed from satsang. If he or she is not removed, then great harm will result. For example, if a person's finger is bitten by a snake, or if it develops gangrene, and if the affected part is not immediately removed, the results would be damaging. Similarly, if a person is recognised as evil, you should immediately shun him.
18.16 "In conclusion, remain wise enough to accept these words of mine. If you do so, I shall consider it to be equivalent to you having served me in every way. I will also bless all of you and be extremely pleased with you. This is because you will have justified my efforts. Moreover, all of us will stay together in the dham of Bhagvan. However, if you do not behave in this way, we will be greatly distanced. Consequently, you will reborn as a ghost or a demon, and you will have to suffer. Of course, the fruits of whatever bhakti you may have previously offered to Bhagvan will be rewarded eventually, but only after great misery. Even then, you will become a mukta and go to Akshardham only by behaving as I have described.
18.17 "Furthermore, if anyone attempts to imitate me, he will definitely suffer. This is because Nar-Narayan resides within my heart. Moreover, I am an eternal mukta. I have not become a mukta through the preaching of others. I exercise complete control over my man, buddhi, chitt, and ahankar. In fact, I seize my antah-karans just as a lion clutches a goat, whereas others cannot even see their antah-karans. Therefore, imitating me, and believing that a person can remain pure even amidst attractive pleasures is just not possible, even for the likes of Narad and the Sanakadik. So what can be said of others?
18.18 "A countless number have become mukta s, and countless more will become mukta s. Amongst them, none have been able to indulge in pleasures of the senses and yet remain uninfluenced by them; none will be able to do so in the future; nor is there anyone like that presently. Even a person who has made an effort for countless millions of years is incapable of remaining uninfluenced amidst temptations. Therefore, if you behave as I have described, you will benefit."
18.19 Continuing, Shreeji Maharaj said, "When I lovingly call someone near, it is for the benefit of their jeev. When I look at someone lovingly, or eat the tasty meals they have prepared, or sit on a decorated bedstead, or accept clothes, jewellery, garlands of flowers, and other offerings – it is all for the good of their jeev, but not for the sake of my personal enjoyment. In fact, I vow on Ramanand Swami that I do not accept those objects for my personal pleasure. Therefore, realising this, none of you should imitate me.
18.20 "Also, keep the activities of your five indriyas extremely pure. Please accept this agna of mine without fail. This fact is simple in that it is comprehensible to all; so all of you will immediately understand it. Moreover, if you extensively announce it throughout satsang, I shall be very pleased indeed."
18.21 Having delivered this talk, Shreeji Maharaj bid "Jay Sachidanand" to all and returned to His residence.

atma-Nishtha, Bhakti, Vairagya, And Svadharma
19.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Posh sud 1 [18th December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as and haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
19.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "In this satsang, those bhaktas who seek their own atyantik kalyan cannot fulfil that aim by atma- nishtha alone; nor can they fulfil that aim by lovingly offering the nine types of bhakti alone; nor can they fulfil that aim by vairagya alone; nor can they fulfil that aim by svadharma alone. Therefore, all four qualties – atma- nishtha, bhakti, vairagya, and svadharma – should be perfected since all are dependent upon each other. Now, please listen as I describe how these four qualities are interdependent.
19.3 "If a person has atma- nishtha, but does not have love towards Bhagvan, then he does not attain the compassion of Bhagvan, which can only be attained by love. Such compassion results in the achievement of the desirable and great divine power of not being overpowered by the gun of Maya. On the other hand, if a person does have love for Bhagvan, but has not attained atma- nishtha, then due to the belief that he is the body, that love cannot be perfected. Also, a person may have both atma- nishtha and love for Bhagvan, but if he lacks firm vairagya, then the desires for worldly five vishays will prevent the perfection of atma- nishtha and love for Bhagvan.
19.4 "Then again, a person may have vairagya, but if he lacks atma- nishtha and love for Bhagvan, he does not experience the profound bliss associated with the svarup of Bhagvan. Also, a person may have svadharma, but if love for Bhagvan, atma- nishtha and vairagya are absent, then he will not be able to rise above Bhur-Lok, Bhuvar-Lok, and all the other loks up to Brahma's Svarg-Lok. That is to say, he will not be able to rise above the brahmands and attain Bhagvan's Akshardham, which is greater than the darkness of Maya. On the other hand, a person may have the three qualities of atma- nishtha, love for Bhagvan, and vairagya; but if svadharma is lacking, the three cannot be perfected.
19.5 "In this way, atma- nishtha and other three qualities are dependent upon each other. A bhakta, who has extremely firmly established these four qualities within himself through the profound association with Bhagvan's ekantik bhaktas, has completed all spiritual activities. Only he should be known as an ekantik bhakta. Therefore, a bhakta having any deficiency in these four qualities should overcome that deficiency by serving and profoundly associating with the ekantik bhakta of Bhagvan."

An Ignorant Person Does Not See His Own Svarup
20.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Posh sud 2 [19th December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was seated on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He had tied a white pagh around His head, and a tassel of yellow flowers had been placed in the pagh. A garland of yellow flowers had been placed around His neck, and bunches of white and yellow flowers had been placed above His ears. He had also covered Himself with a white chofal and was wearing a khes with a black border. The katha was being read. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
20.2 Then, Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj said, "Please listen, I wish to ask all of you a question."
20.3 Hearing this, all the haribhaktas said with folded hands, "Please do ask."
20.4 Shreeji Maharaj then asked, "Who is the most ignorant of all ignorant people?"
20.5 Everyone pondered over the question, but no one was able to reply. So, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Here, I shall answer myself."
20.6 Hearing this, everyone was pleased and said, "Maharaj, only you will be able to give a precise answer, so please explain."
20.7 Shreeji Maharaj then began, "The jeev, which resides within the body, observes both the attractive and the unattractive. It witnesses childhood, youth, and old age, as well as a countless number of other things. However, the observer ( jeev) fails to observe its own svarup. The jeev looks at objects externally, but it does not look at its own svarup. Therefore, it is the most ignorant of the ignorant.
20.8 "Furthermore, just as the jeev indulges in a countless variety of sights with the eyes, it similarly indulges in and knows the pleasures of the other vishays with the ears, skin, tongue, and nose. However, it does not indulge in the bliss of its own svarup and nor does it know its own nature. For this reason, it is the most ignorant of the ignorant, the most senseless of the senseless, the most foolish of fools, and the vilest of the vile."
20.9 At that point, Shuk Muni raised a doubt. He asked, "Is it truly in a person's own hands to see his own svarup? If it is, why does the jeev remain ignorant?"
20.10 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "For a person who has attained satsang, darshan of his jeevatma lies in his own hands. In fact, when has he attempted to see his own svarup and failed to see it? Having become dependent on and made helpless by maya, that jeev draws within, and enters the svapna and sushupti states, but never does it draw within of its own accord to see its own svarup. On the other hand, a person who thinks about the greatness of Bhagvan and draws within himself sees his own svarup as extremely pure and luminous. In the midst of the luminance, he beholds the murti of Purushottam Bhagvan, and experiences bliss in the way of Narad and the Sanakadik. Therefore, all deficiencies in a bhakta are due to his own laziness."

Svadharma - The Two Forms Of Akshar
21.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Posh sud 3 [19th December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a khes with a black border, and had covered Himself with a white cotton cloth. He had also tied a white pagh around His head. A sabha of sadhu s, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the sadhu s were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a jhanjh and pakhvaj.
21.2 Shreeji Maharaj quietened the sabha and said, "Please listen, I wish to tell you something." Having said this, He sat in deep thought with His eyes closed for quite some time.
21.3 Then, He said, "A haribhakta, who in his mind desires to intensely please Bhagvan, can do so by the following means: unshakeable determination in abiding by the dharma of his varna and ashram; firm atma- nishtha; dislike for all objects except Bhagvan; and bhakti which is without any desires for rewards, and which is accompanied with an understanding of Bhagvan's greatness. Bhagvan is extremely pleased by these four spiritual activities. These spiritual activities are collectively known as ekantik dharma. At present, there are many bhaktas in our satsang, who possess ekantik dharma.
21.4 "A bhakta of Bhagvan should think of the murti of Bhagvan while eating, drinking, bathing, washing, walking, sitting, and all other activities. He should particularly think of Bhagvan and continuously think of His murti when there is no mental disturbance within. However, when there is some internal disturbance due to random thoughts, he should realise his own self to be distinct from the body, the indriyas, the antah-karans, and the vishays, and their presiding devs. Only when those disturbing thoughts diminish, should he think of the murti of Bhagvan.
21.5 "The body should not be believed to be a person's true self, nor should a person's bodily relations be regarded as his true relations. This is because the jeev has previously taken birth in each of the 8.4 million life-forms. In fact, the jeev has taken birth in the wombs of all females in this world; it has also taken birth numerous times in the wombs of all the dogs, cats, monkeys, and other types of life-forms in the cycle of 8.4 million life-forms. Also, of all the different types of females in this world, which has it not previously made its wife? All have been its wife at one time or another. Similarly, with numerous female bodies, that jeev has also made all the different forms of males, its husband.
21.6 "Therefore, just as a person does not believe the relations of those previous 8.4 million life-forms to be his true relations, and just as he does not believe the bodies of those 8.4 million to be his true relations, and just as he does not believe the bodies of those 8.4 million life-forms to be his true body, in the same way, a person should not believe this present body to be his true self, nor should he believe the relations of this body to be his true relations.
21.7 "Therefore, a person should offer bhakti to Bhagvan day by day, and should also constantly keep the company of a sadhu, while regarding all possessions and all objects as asatya, while having realised himself to be distinct from the body, indriyas, and antah-karans, and while following his own dharma.
21.8 "A person who does not have this understanding – who identifies himself with the body, and who has an ordinary attitude – should be thought of as an animal, even if he is presently in satsang. Yet, in this satsang, even animals attain kalyan by the intense grace of Bhagvan. So, what is so special about humans attaining kalyan? However, such a person cannot be called a true ekantik bhakta of Bhagvan. Only a person possessing the understanding previously described can be called an ekantik bhakta. After such an ekantik bhakta leaves his body and becomes free of all influences of maya, he attains Akshardham via the archimarg.
21.9 "Akshar has two forms. One, which is formless and pure chaitanya, is known as Chidakash or Brahm-Mahol. In its other form, Akshar remains in the seva of Purushottam- Narayan. A bhakta who has reached Akshardham attains qualities similar to those of Akshar, and forever remains in the seva of Bhagvan. Furthermore, Shree Krishna Purushottam- Narayan is forever seated in that Akshardham. The countless millions of muktas, who have attained Akshardham, behave as the das of Bhagvan. Purushottam- Narayan Himself is the master of them all, and the master of the kings of all the countless millions of brahmands.
21.10 "Keeping this in mind, all of our satsangis should develop the following singular belief: 'We also wish to sit beside the akshar-rup muktas, and we wish to go to Akshardham, and forever remain in the seva of Bhagvan. We have no desire for the temporary and mayik worldly pleasures, and nor do we wish to be tempted by them in any way'. Keeping such a firm belief, a person should offer ekantik bhakti to Bhagvan.
21.11 "By thoroughly understanding the greatness of Bhagvan, a person should eradicate his desires for women, wealth, and all objects other than Bhagvan. If desires for objects other than Bhagvan are to remain, then if on the path to Akshardham he is tempted by these objects, he will abandon Bhagvan and be lured by those objects instead. This would prove to be a major disaster. Therefore, a person should worship Bhagvan after overcoming desires for all objects."

Gadhada I – 22
Remember Bhagvan During All Activities
22.1 In the Samvat year 1876, at noon on Posh sud 4 [20th December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was seated on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A tassel of flowers had been inserted in His pagh, and bunches of flowers had been placed above both of His ears. He was also wearing a garland of guldavadi flowers around His neck. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. The paramhans were singing kirtans.
22.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Please listen. I wish to tell you something."
22.3 Hearing this, the paramhans stopped singing and prepared themselves to listen.
22.4 Shreeji Maharaj continued, "If a person does not remember Bhagvan while singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a mrudang, a sarangi, a saroda, and other musical instruments, then that singing is as good as not having sung at all. There are many people in the world who sing and play instruments without remembering Bhagvan, but they do not attain peace of mind. Therefore, whichever activity a person performs – whether it is singing kirtans, reciting Bhagvan's name, or singing the Narayan dhun, – he should only perform that activity while remembering the murti of Bhagvan.
22.5 "If a person specifically attempts to engage himself in bhajan, he may only be able to focus his vrutti on Bhagvan. However, after completing those acts of bhajan if he does not keep vrutti in Bhagvan while performing daily duties, his vrutti will not be steady on the murti of Bhagvan even if he attempts to engage in bhajan again. Therefore, a person should practice maintaining his vrutti on the svarup of Bhagvan while walking, eating, and drinking – in fact, during all activities. If he does this, his vrutti becomes fixed on Bhagvan when he engages in bhajan as well. Moreover, when his vrutti begins to remain on Bhagvan, it remains so even during other work. If a person is stupid and ignorant, then he will not be able to keep vrutti in Bhagvan, even when he does bhajan. Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvan should carefully practice maintaining his vrutti on the murti of Bhagvan."
22.6 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj requested, "Now please sing kirtans."

The Nature Of A Bhakta With Strong Sthiti
23.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Posh sud 5 [21st December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He had tied a white feto around His head and was wearing a white angarkhu and white surval. He had also tied a deep orange shelu around His waist. A sabha of paramhans, as well as satsangis from various places, had gathered before Him.
23.2 Out of compassion, Shreeji Maharaj then began to speak to the paramhans, "The Vasudev Mahatmya shastra is extremely dear to me, as it describes all the methods of how bhaktas of Bhagvan should worship Him."
23.3 Shreeji Maharaj then continued, "There are two types of bhaktas of Bhagvan: One bhakta has complete nishchay in Bhagvan, yet worships Bhagvan identifying himself with the body. The other, believes his own svarup to be chaitanya, and beyond the influence of the three mental states ( jagrat, svapna, sushupti) and the three bodies ( sthul, sukshma, and karan). This bhakta worships Bhagvan while seeing Bhagvan's murti within his own svarup. As a result, he sees his own svarup, which is beyond the three mental states and the three bodies, as being extremely full of divine light. Within that light, he sees the murti of Bhagvan, just as it is in its pratyaksha svarup, as being extremely luminous. Such is the sthiti of this bhakta.
23.4 "As long as a person has not attained this sthiti, he is subject to obstacles, even if he is a bhakta of Bhagvan. For example, Shivji did not have this sthiti and was therefore enticed by the beauty of Mohini. Brahma also did not have this sthiti, and therefore became attracted to the svarup of Sarasvati. Naradji also did not have such sthiti, and consequently had a desire to marry. Others like Indra and Chandra, who were not behaving with this sthiti, also had their reputations blemished due to their mistakes.
23.5 "Furthermore, if a person has not developed this sthiti, he will identify worldly characteristics even in Bhagvan, even if he himself is a bhakta of Bhagvan. Parikshit Raja was not such a bhakta who had this sthiti, and so he raised doubts about the divinity of Shree Krishna Bhagvan after hearing of the ras- leela. On the other hand, because Shukji was such an elevated bhakta, he had no doubts whatsoever. Such a bhakta firmly realises 'If no flaws can affect me or bind me in any way, how can there possibly be any mayik flaws in Bhagvan, by whose worship I have become like this?' A bhakta with this sthiti firmly realises this.
23.6 "When such a bhakta of Bhagvan focuses his vrutti on the svarup of Bhagvan, that vrutti is divided into two. Of these, one vrutti focuses on the svarup of Bhagvan, while the other focuses within the worshipper himself. The vrutti that is fixed on Bhagvan's svarup is applied lovingly, whereas the vrutti that is fixed on the worshipper himself is full of thoughts. This vrutti that is full of thoughts neutralises all other thoughts and desires – except those of worshipping Bhagvan – that may arise in the worshipper himself. In this way, the vrutti of such a bhakta constantly remains on Bhagvan.
23.7 "A person who at times worships Bhagvan with a concentrated mind, and at other times indulges in worldly thoughts, does not develop this sthiti. For example, consider a pot that is filled with water and emptied somewhere. If another pot of water is subsequently emptied at the same place on the following day or the day after that, a pool of water will not collect there. This is because the water poured on the first day dried up on that very day, and water poured after also dries up on that same day. On the other hand, if a trickle of water were to flow continuously, a large pool of water will soon be formed. Therefore, while eating, drinking, walking, and engaging in any activity whatsoever – whether it is pure or impure – in fact, at all times, a person should constantly keep his vrutti of Bhagvan. While maintaining his vrutti constantly on Bhagvan in this way, he attains strong sthiti."

Sthiti Attained By Gnan - The 'Sourness' Of Bhagvan's Greatness
24.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Posh sud 6 [22nd December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He had tied a white feto around His head, and was wearing a white khes. Also, He had put on a warm, red dagli and had covered Himself with a white chofal. A sabha of paramhans, as well as satsangis from various places, had gathered before Him.
24.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said to the paramhans, "I shall explain how sthiti can be attained by gnan. What is this gnan like? Well, it is greater than Prakruti and Purush. When sthiti is attained by this gnan, Prakruti- Purush and their actions do not come into view. This is known as gnan- pralay. A person, who has attained this sthiti, sees only pure chaitanya, within which only the murti of Bhagvan resides, with no other forms remaining. At times, a person cannot even see the murti of Bhagvan within that divine light; only the light is seen. At other times however, both the divine light and the murti of Bhagvan are seen. This is known as sthiti attained by gnan. Such sthiti is attained by constantly maintaining the vrutti on the visible murti of Bhagvan."
24.3 Continuing, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The extent to which a person has understood the greatness of Bhagvan determines the intensity of both the divine light experienced in the heart, and the divine sounds of pranav that are heard. Furthermore, the extent of a person's nishchay and understanding of the greatness of Bhagvan determines the extent to which vicious thoughts are diminished. Therefore, when a person develops absolute nishchay in Bhagvan and thoroughly understands His greatness, all of his vicious thoughts are eliminated.
24.4 "For example, if a person has sucked a slice of lemon, his teeth become a little sensitive, but he is still able to chew soft chickpeas. However, if he has sucked a whole lemon, he is unable to chew chickpeas, and will even have difficulty chewing mung beans. If he has sucked many lemons, he would be unable to chew cooked rice. In the same way, when a person has developed 'sourness' ( nishchay) in Bhagvan and an understanding of His greatness, his gums as the four antah-karans and the ten indriyas, become sensitised. In that state, with its gums as the man, the jeev is unable to chew chickpeas (thoughts for the vishays). With its gums as the chitt, the jeev becomes incapable of thinking of the vishays. With its gums as the buddhi, the jeev becomes incapable of developing a determination for the vishays. With its gums as the ahankar, the jeev becomes incapable of developing any form of consciousness related to the vishays. Similarly, the jeev, with its gums as five gnan- indriyas and five karma-indriyas, becomes incapable of chewing chickpeas ( vishays).
24.5 "However, the indriyas and the antah-karans of a person who does not have absolute nishchay in Bhagvan and who has not fully realised the greatness of Bhagvan, do not withdraw completely from their vishays."
24.6 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "The svarup of Bhagvan is greater than Maya and its gun, and is free of all types of flaws; but, it is for the sake of the kalyan of jeevs that He appears to be like a human. In fact, Bhagvan does not have any of the flaws that foolish people assign to Him. However, the intellect of the person who describes Bhagvan with such flaws will never be freed of those flaws that he assigns to Bhagvan. Specifically, a person who believes Bhagvan to be full of kam will himself become intensely full of kam; a person who believes Bhagvan to be full of krodh will himself become intensely full of krodh; a person who believes Bhagvan to be full of lobh will himself become intensely full of lobh; and a person who believes Bhagvan to be full of irshya will himself become intensively full of irshya. In fact, whatever types of flaws a person assigns to Bhagvan will ultimately cause misery to the person himself – just as a fistful of sand thrown at the sun falls back into the eyes of the thrower.
24.7 "On the other hand, if a person understands Bhagvan to be absolutely flawless, then regardless of his own svabhav s, he himself becomes absolutely flawless as well."
24.8 Then, Brahmanand Swami asked, "Suppose there is a person whose indriyas are not drawn towards any of the vishays, nor do vicious thoughts arise in his antah-karans. He also has absolute nishchay in Bhagvan. Despite this, a feeling of dissatisfaction remains, and he feels hopeless within. What can be the reason for this?"
24.9 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "That is a major deficiency in the bhakta. Despite the fact that his mind has become stable and that he has firm nishchay in Bhagvan, he still fails to experience intense happiness in his heart. In particular, he does not feel, 'I am extremely fortunate and completely fulfilled, whereas others in the world are constantly being troubled by kam, krodh, lobh, moh, mad, matsar, asha, trushna. They are subject to the three types of sufferings day and night. As for me, Purushottam Bhagvan has compassionately revealed His own svarup to me. He has also freed me from kam, krodh, and all the other vicious natures. He has also placed me in the company of sadhus similar to Narad and the Sanakadik. Indeed, I am very fortunate'.
24.10 "Failing to think in this way and failing to remain extremely delighted throughout the day is a major deficiency. In fact, such a bhakta can be compared to a child who has been given a chintamani in its hand, but derives no happiness from it as the child does not realise the chintamani's value. Similarly, the major flaw in that bhakta is that despite having attained Purushottam Bhagvan, he does not feel constant delight within by realising, 'I am completely fulfilled'.
24.11 "Moreover, when a fault is noticed in a haribhakta, a person should think, 'His svabhav is such that it is not suitable in satsang; nevertheless, he has attained satsang. Regardless of what he is like, he has still remained in satsang. Then, surely his sanskars from past lives or from this very life must be extremely favourable for him to have attained this satsang'. With this understanding, he should highly appreciate even such a person's gun."
24.12 After this talk, Shreeji Maharaj bid "Jay Sachidanand" to everyone and returned to His residence.

atma-Nishtha- Knowledge Of Bhagvan Leads To Fulfilment 
25.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the morning of Posh sud 7 [23rd December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj arrived at the residence of the paramhans in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chofal. He had also tied a white feto around His head. He was sitting facing east on the western veranda. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
25.2 Out of compassion, Shreeji Maharaj then said, "A bhakta of Bhagvan, who follows only svadharma, does not feel completely fulfilled within his heart. That feeling of fulfilment can only be attained by atma- nishtha and the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness. Moreover, absence of these two qualities, determines the extent of the deficiency in this experience of fulfilment. Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvan should firmly develop these two qualities.
25.3 "The deficiency remaining in these two factors also determines the extent of the difficulty experienced during samadhi. Recently, I granted samadhi to a haribhakta in which she saw intense divine light. Seeing the light, she began to scream, and she shouted, 'I'm burning!' Therefore, even those who experience samadhi, require knowledge of the atma. If a person does not realise his own svarup to be the atma, and instead believes his svarup to be the body, the deficiency will remain.
25.4 "I explained to that bhakta, 'Your svarup is the atma, not the body. You are not this Ladkibai of the Bhat sub-caste; instead, your svarup is the atma, which is achhedhya and abhedhya'. I then placed her into samadhi again and told her, ' Go to the four-petalled kamal at the site of Ganpati, and look at your svarup there'.
25.5 "When a person in samadhi enters the site of Ganpati, that person hears divine sounds and sees divine light. When he enters the higher place of Brahma, he hears louder sounds and sees brighter light. When he enters the still higher place of Vishnu, he hears even louder sounds and sees even brighter light. In this way, as he enters higher and higher locations, he hears increasingly louder sounds and sees increasingly brighter light. As a result of the intense divine light seen in samadhi, and the loud thunderous sounds that occur, even the most strong-minded become fearful.
25.6 "For example, despite being a bhakta of Bhagvan and despite being extremely brave, Arjun was incapable of beholding Bhagvan's Vishvarup form. He therefore pleaded, 'O Maharaj! I am incapable of beholding this svarup of yours. Please grant me darshan of your former svarup'. Similarly, in samadhi, when thundering noises like those of an entire brahmand exploding are heard, and masses of intense light like overflowing oceans are seen, even the brave lose their patience. Therefore, a person should understand his own svarup to be distinct from the body.
25.7 "Samadhi experienced in this way is achieved in two ways. One is by controlling the prans through pranayam, whereby the chitt is also controlled. The other is by controlling the chitt, whereby the prans are also controlled. When is control over the chitt achieved? It is achieved when a person's vrutti s are detached from everything else and focused only on Bhagvan. However, these vrutti s can be focused on Bhagvan only when desires for everything else are overcome and only a singular desire for the svarup of Bhagvan remains. Then, those vrutti s will not be deflected from Bhagvan's svarup by any means whatsoever. For example, if twenty pails of water were drawn from a water-well, and the flow of water from each pail flowed in separate directions, then there would be little force in each flow. However, if the flows of all twenty pails of water are combined, then the resultant flow would become extremely powerful – like that of a river – and would not be able to be diverted by any means whatsoever. Similarly, when a person's vrutti s have become free of worldly desires, his chitt focuses only on Bhagvan's svarup.
25.8 "Conversely, when a person has desires in his chitt for the pleasures of the world, his vrutti is widely dispersed among thousands of different types of sounds heard via the ear; the vrutti of the skin is dispersed among thousands of different types of touch sensations that are felt; the vrutti of the eyes is dispersed among thousands of different types of things that are seen; the vrutti of the tongue is dispersed among thousands of different types of tastes; the vrutti of the nose is dispersed among countless types of smells. In the same way, the vrutti s of his karma- indriyas are dispersed among their respective vishays in thousands of different ways. In this way, via the ten indriyas, his antah-karans are dispersed in thousands of different ways. Only when his chitt thinks about Bhagvan, and his man generates thoughts of Bhagvan, and his buddhi establishes the nishchay in the svarup of Bhagvan, and his ahankar thinks 'I am the atma, and a bhakta of Bhagvan', can his desire for Bhagvan be known to have become singular.
25.9 "Alternatively, the control of the chitt by controlling the prans is achieved by ashtang- yog, which comprises of eight stages: yam, niyam, asan, pranayam, pratyahar, dharan, dhyan, and samadhi. This ashtang- yog is the method, and its gift is the nirvikalp samadhi of Bhagvan. When this nirvikalp samadhi is achieved, the chitt is controlled by controlling the prans. On the other hand, if the chitt focuses on Bhagvan after becoming free of worldly desires, then the prans are controlled by control of the chitt.
25.10 "Therefore, just as the chitt is controlled by mastering ashtang- yog, similarly, the chitt can also be controlled by focusing on the svarup of Bhagvan. A bhakta whose chitt's vrutti becomes focused on the svarup of Bhagvan, masters ashtang– yog without even attempting to master it. Therefore, the spiritual activities of atma– nishtha and the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness that I have just described should be firmly practiced.
25.11 "Furthermore, a person's vartman dharma – which are Bhagvan's agna – should certainly be followed. For example, the dharma of a brahman is to bathe, lead a pure life, and never drink even water from a shudra's house. Similarly, a satsangi should never falter in following Bhagvan's agna. This is because Bhagvan will be pleased with him if he behaves accordingly.
25.12 "Moreover, a person should very firmly maintain both the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness as well as the knowledge of the atma coupled with vairagya. He should also feel fulfilled by realising, 'Now I have no deficiencies remaining'. With this understanding, he should constantly offer bhakti to Bhagvan. Having said this, he should not get carried away in the joy of this understanding, and nor should he feel unfulfilled. If he does feel unfulfilled, then the blessings that have been showered upon him by Bhagvan can be considered as not having germinated – like a seed sown in saline soil. Conversely, if he gets carried away and begins to behave disobediently, then that is like having thrown a seed into a fire, which burns it. Therefore, if a person understands as I have explained, then no form of deficiency will remain."
25.13 After saying this, Shreeji Maharaj returned to His seat.

A True Rasik Bhakta - The Nirgun State
26.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the afternoon of Posh sud 11 [27th December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He had tied a white pagh around His head. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chofal. Two large guldavadi flowers had been placed upon His ears, and a tassel of flowers had been inserted in His pagh. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the paramhans were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a pakhvaj.
26.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Please stop singing, and listen as I sing a kirtan in the form of talks."
26.3 The paramhans said, "Very well, Maharaj. Please do."
26.4 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "If a person is attracted only by Bhagvan's svarup while singing rasik kirtans, then that is fine. But, being attracted to anything other than Bhagvan's svarup signifies a major deficiency. This is because just as that bhakta develops affection for and is attracted by sounds related to Bhagvan, he also develops affection for and is attracted by worldly songs, musical instruments, and talks related to women. Such a bhakta should be known to lack wisdom. Therefore, a person who is attracted equally by the words of Bhagvan and His sant, and by worldly speech, should abandon such foolishness. Having abandoned such foolishness, he should experience happiness through sounds and speech related only to Bhagvan. Such a person is a true rasik bhakta.
26.5 "Furthermore, just as that rasik bhakta wishes for sounds related only to Bhagvan, he desires only the touch of Bhagvan. When he realises that other types of touch are like touching a black cobra or a blazing fire, he is a true rasik bhakta. Similarly, if a person experiences extreme bliss on seeing Bhagvan, and realises everything else to be like a pile of filth or a dead dog, then he is true rasik bhakta. Similarly, if a person experiences extreme bliss after tasting the prasad of Bhagvan, and not from enjoying other various types of tastes, then he is a true rasik bhakta.
26.6 "Furthermore, such a bhakta experiences profound bliss on smelling tulsi, garlands of flowers, and many varieties of small fragrant items like perfume and sandalwood that have been offered to Bhagvan. He is not pleased on smelling the perfume, sandalwood, or garlands of flowers worn by people. In this way, a person who has intense love for panch- vishays related to Bhagvan and an intense dislike for worldly panch- vishays is a true rasik bhakta.
26.7 "On the other hand, a person who becomes a rasik bhakta, but still derives the same pleasure from other types of shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh as he does from Bhagvan–related vishays, is a false rasik bhakta. This is because he experiences the same type of joy from vishays as he does from Bhagvan. Therefore, such affection and mode of worship should be abandoned. This is because it is not Bhagvan who is at fault – it is the rasik bhakta's attitude that is at fault, as he has believed Bhagvan to be exactly like other objects. As a result, his bhakti and affection are flawed.
26.8 "Now, just as I have described caution in indulging in the five types of vishays for the sthul body in the jagrat state, similarly, subtle vishays exist for the sukshma body in the svapna state. A bhakta may experience happiness from shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh related to Bhagvan on seeing the svarup of Bhagvan in his dream, but if he also derives exactly the same pleasure on seeing other vishays in his dream, then that bhakta's affection is false. On the other hand, if a person in his dream experiences happiness only by association with Bhagvan and feels a dislike for other vishays as if they were vomited food, then he can be said to be a true rasik bhakta. However, if he does not have a dislike for the other vishays, then although the svarup of Bhagvan seen in his dream is true, that bhakta's understanding is flawed. This is because he has equal love for Bhagvan and for other vishays. Therefore, true understanding is to remain attracted only towards the svarup of Bhagvan, and not towards other vishays.
26.9 "In this way, when only thoughts of Bhagvan remain while thinking, the mind becomes completely void, with the exception of the murti of Bhagvan, and that bhakta does not identify the body or the brahmand at all. Then, while seeing the murti of Bhagvan within that void, divine light is generated, and the murti of Bhagvan is seen within that light. So, love towards only the svarup of Bhagvan in this way, is called pati-vrata bhakti."
26.10 In conclusion, Shreeji Maharaj added, "When you sing rasik kirtans, I also close my eyes and think about just this. These thoughts of mine may be simple, but nothing is able to persist in those thoughts except Bhagvan. In fact, my thoughts are so powerful that if any vishay were to come in the way of the rasik love that I have for Bhagvan's svarup, its head would be cut off. Just as you prepare a kirtan to sing, I prepared this kirtan in the form of a talk, which I have shared with you all today."
26.11 In this way, using Himself as an example, Shreeji Maharaj delivered these talks for the benefit of His bhaktas.

The Power Of Bhagvan - Bhagvan Resides In The Heart Of A Sant
27.1 In the Samvat year 1876, before sunrise on Posh sud 12 [28th December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj arrived at the residential hall of the paramhans in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. There, He sat on a platform facing west. He had tied a white feto around His head, and he was wearing a khes. He had also covered Himself with a white chofal. A sabha of paramhans had gathered before Him.
27.2 After a few minutes of deep thought, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Everyone wishes to worship Bhagvan, but their understanding differs. Bhagvan fully resides in the heart of a person who possesses the following understanding: 'The earth remains stable and trembles; the stars remain steady in the sky; the rains fall; the sun rises and sets; the moon appears and disappears, and it waxes and wanes; the vast oceans remain constrained within their boundaries; a drop of liquid develops into a human possessing hands, feet, a nose, ears, and the rest of the ten indriyas; the clouds, through which lightning strikes, float unsupported in the sky – these and a countless variety of the other wonders are only due to the Bhagvan that I have attained'. With this understanding, he has the belief that no one except the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan is the cause of these wonders. He realises, 'The countless wonders which have occurred in the past, those which are currently taking place, and those which will occur in the future, are all only due to the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan that I have attained'.
27.3 "Moreover, he also understands that 'Even if someone were to throw dust on me, or were to humiliate me in any way, or were to seat me on a donkey after cutting off my nose and ears, or even if someone were to honour me by seating me on an elephant – all these situations would be equal for me'. Such a bhakta views a beautiful young woman with equality, he treats a heap of gold and a pile of stones with equality, and he also possesses countless glorious qualities, such as gnan, bhakti, and vairagya. Bhagvan eternally resides in the heart of such a bhakta.
27.4 "Consequently, by the grace of Bhagvan, that bhakta attains countless types of power, and gives kalyan to countless beings. Despite these powers, he tolerates the praises and insults of other people. This itself is also a great achievement, because to tolerate insults, despite being so powerful, is not easy for others to achieve. Therefore, a person who tolerates in this way should be considered to be extremely great.
27.5 "The powers of such a person are such that Bhagvan sees through his eyes, which empowers the eyes of all the beings in the brahmand; and since it is Bhagvan who walks through his legs, he is also capable of giving the strength to walk to the legs of all the beings in the brahmand. Therefore, since it is Bhagvan who resides in all the indriyas of such a sant, that sant us able to give power to the indriyas of all the life-forms in the brahmand. Therefore, such a sant sustains the world. His greatness lies in the fact that he tolerates the insults delivered even by insignificant people. Only those who are forgiving in this way should be considered to be extremely great.
27.6 "On the other hand, those who threaten and frighten those who are more humble than themselves, and believe 'I have become great', are not truly great. In fact, those people in this world who frighten others by showing extraordinary powers, should not be considered to be bhakta s of Bhagvan. Instead, they are jeevs lost in maya, and are only suitable for Yampuri. Their greatness is limited to the worldly life. For example, in society, a person with one horse is considered to be greater than someone with no horses at all, whereas a person with five horses is considered to be greater than someone with only one horse. In this way, the wealthier a person is, the greater he is considered to be in society. However, such a person is not great in worshipping Bhagvan."
27.7 Continuing, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A g rahastha or s adhu who believes, 'This woman is very beautiful; these clothes are extremely fashionable; this medi is very nice; and this utensil is very lovely', has little knowledge. Then, you may ask, 'Will such people attain kalyan or not?' Well, in this satsang, even the wretched attain kalyan. However, the people described never develop the qualities of a sadhu, or the glorious qualities of the sant previously described. This is because they have not become suitable for such nobility."
27.8 After delivering these talks, Shreeji Maharaj bid "Jay Sachidanand" to all, and returned to His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar.

Gadhada I – 28
The Nature Of A Person Who Will Fall From Satsang
28.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Posh sud 14 [30th December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the room in line with the room of Shree Vasudev-Narayan, in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, the sadhu s had sat down to eat in His presence.
28.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "When a satsangi is likely to fall from satsang, vicious desires steadily flourish within him. At first, he begins to perceive avgun in all satsangis day by day. In his heart, he feels, ' All of these satsangis lack understanding; only I have true understanding'. In this way, he considers himself to be superior to all. Such a person remains constantly uneasy, day and night. He cannot sit peacefully anywhere during the day; nor can he sleep at night. Moreover, his anger never subsides. In fact, he constantly smoulders like a half-burnt log. A person who behaves in this way should be known to be on the verge of falling out of satsang. No matter how many days he spends in satsang, he will never experience peace in his heart. Therefore, he will fall from satsang.
28.3 "Conversely, when a person is likely to advance in satsang, pure desires steadily flourish within him. Day by day, he perceives only gun in all satsangis; he views all bhaktas as superior to himself and considers himself to be insignificant. Moreover, he experiences the bliss of satsang in his heart twenty-four hours a day. Such characteristics indicate that pure desires have flourished. In fact, the more such a person practices satsang, the more he benefits. Eventually, he attains extreme greatness."
28.4 Having delivered this talk, Shreeji Maharaj bid "Jay Sachidanand" to all and returned to His seat.

Intensifying Dharma, Gnan, Vairagya, And Bhakti - Prarabdha, Grace, And Effort
29.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Posh sud Punam [31st December, 1819], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chofal. He had also tied a white pagh around His head. He was wearing garlands of white flowers, and a tassel of white flowers was hanging from His pagh. A sabha of sadhu s, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
29.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Please ask a question."
29.3 Then, Gopalanand Swami asked, "How can the force of bhakti coupled with dharma, gnan, and vairagya be intensified?"
29.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "There are four means to accomplish this: The first is a pure desh, the second is a pleasant kal, the third is spiritual kriya, and the fourth is the sang of a sat-purush. Of these, the influence of desh, kal, and sang are more powerful than kriya. This is because, if a desh is pure, and kal is pure, and a person also keeps the sang of sant like yourself, then kriya will naturally be pure as well. Conversely, if a desh is impure – like the region of Sindh, if the kal is impure, and if a person also keeps the sang of prostitutes and perverted people, or of those who consume alcohol and meat, then kriya will certainly be impure as well. Therefore, a person should stay where there is a pure desh, and should abandon a place where the kal has become unpleasant. A person should keep the sang of a bhakta of Bhagvan, as well as the sang of a sant who abides by the panch-vartman. As a result, a haribhakta's bhakti for Bhagvan gains tremendous energy. This is the answer to your question."
29.5 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, initially a haribhakta may be very impure at heart, but he later becomes extremely pure. Is this due to his previous sanskars, the grace of Bhagvan, or the bhakta's personal efforts?"
29.6 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The good or bad that occurs due to person's previous sanskars is apparent to everyone in the world. For instance, the cause of Bharatji becoming attached to a deer can be understood to be due to prarabdha. Or, if a poor person were to receive a large kingdom, then everyone would come to know of it. That should be known as prarabdha."
29.7 Then, narrating His own story, Shreeji Maharaj continued, "Considering the spiritual activities I have performed, it is unimaginable that my body has survived such strictness, yet even in those circumstances it did survive. That can be considered to be due to prarabdha. What were those circumstances? Well, while staying in Purushottam-Puri, I spent many months surviving merely on air. On one occasion, I allowed my body to be carried away by a river that was four to five miles wide. During the winter, summer, and monsoon, I stayed without shelter, wearing only a loincloth. I also used to wander in the jungle amongst wild animals such as tigers, elephants, and wildebeests. I travelled in many frightful conditions, yet my body did not perish. In these situations, a person should consider prarabdha to be responsible.
29.8 "Now, consider the son of the brahman named Sandipani whose son was saved from Narak, and when five-year-old Dhruvji prayed to Bhagvan, the meanings of the Veds and other shastras were spontaneously revealed to him. In these situations – as well as when a person's mind is purified by the wish of Bhagvan or by His grace, or by the grace of His ekantik sadhu who has been pleased by a person's extremely pure sentiments – the influence of Bhagvan's grace should be considered to be responsible.
29.9 "If a person keeps the sang of a devout sadhu and becomes virtuous through his own thoughts, then that is known as purush-prayatna."
29.10 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj bid "Jay Sachidanand" to the sabha and returned to His seat laughing.

The Influence Of The Gun Of Maya
30.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Posh vad 1 [1st January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the room facing north, in line with the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan, in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a white feto around His head, with tassels of white flowers hanging from it. He was wearing a garland of white flowers, bunches of white flowers were placed above His ears. He was also wearing berkha of white flowers around His wrists. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the munis were singing kirtans.
30.2 Shreeji Maharaj then requested, "Please begin a question-answer discussion."
30.3 Dina-Nath Bhatt then asked, "At times, thousands of thoughts arise, yet they do not leave a lasting impression in the mind. At other times, only an irrelevant thought arises, yet it leaves a strong impression in the mind. What is the reason for this? Also, by what means can a bhakta eliminate such disturbing thoughts?"
30.4 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "The reason is the influence of the gun. Thoughts occurring when tamo-gun is predominant, induce a state similar to that of sushupti. Therefore, those thoughts do not leave a lasting impression in the mind. When sattva-gun prevails, a person experiences a state of awareness. Therefore, any disturbing thoughts that occur at that time, are dispelled by thinking. Therefore, those thoughts do not leave a lasting impression either. However, thoughts that arise when rajo-gun is prevalent, leave a lasting impression in the mind. Therefore, the reason some thoughts do leave a lasting impression in the mind and others do not, is due to the prevalence of the different gun.
30.5 "If an intelligent person reflects on this matter and examines his thoughts whenever they arise, he will be able to recognise which gun is predominant in him at that particular time. However, subtle thoughts that arise repeatedly from moment to moment cannot be grasped by anyone. At the most, someone intelligent like yourself may be able to distinguish two, three, or four of the more superficial thoughts that arise during the course of a day.
30.6 "So, if a person examines the predominant gun under whose influence his thoughts arise, and thinks about the spiritual talks which takes place in satsang, then the power of satsang is such that any disturbing thoughts, which arise under the influence of the gun, are dispelled. Then, becoming free from all doubts, he is able to continuously concentrate on the svarup of Bhagvan.
30.7 "Without satsang, even if a person carries out millions of spiritual activities, disturbing thoughts and the influence of rajo-gun and the other gun will not be eradicated. Therefore, if someone sincerely practices satsang and reflects upon the talks relating to Bhagvan, then his vile thoughts will be eradicated. In this way, the influence of satsang is extremely powerful. In fact, no other spiritual activity can compare with satsang. Therefore, a person who wishes to rid the mind of thoughts related to rajo-gun, should sincerely practice satsang by thought, word, and deed. As a result, disturbing thoughts will be eradicated due to the power of satsang."

The Person With Bhakti Is Best
31.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Posh vad 2 [2nd January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow that had been placed on the east-facing veranda outside His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes.
31.2 At that time, Yoganand Muni asked, "Maharaj, suppose there are two bhaktas of Bhagvan. One bhakta follows nivrutti and does not hurt anyone verbally. The other, is constantly serving Bhagvan and His bhaktas, by offering food, clothes, and flowers. However, in doing so, he may occasionally hurt someone verbally. Of these two bhaktas, who is better?"
31.3 Shreeji Maharaj did not answer the question. Instead, He called for Muktanand Swami and Brahmanand Swami. He had them listen to the question, and then requested, "Please answer this question."
31.4 Both Muktanand Swami and Brahmanand Swami then answered. "The bhakta who may verbally hurt someone, but serves Bhagvan and His sant, is better. The bhakta who follows nivrutti and does not hurt anyone, and is therefore unable to serve Bhagvan and His sant, should therefore be known to be feeble. The bhakta who serves others can be described as having bhakti. Therefore, the bhakta with bhakti is the better of the two."
31.5 Shreeji Maharaj confirmed, "The answer you have given is correct." He then added, "It is a major weakness if a person notices a small avgun in someone who possesses this bhakti and completely abides by Bhagvan's agna, and then develops hatred for him. A person who perceives avgun in this way may also perceive avgun in Bhagvan, who has assumed a human form for the purpose of granting kalyan to the jeevs. He may also perceive avgun in the profoundly great bhaktas of Bhagvan.
31.6 "Moreover, just because such a person alleges such faults in Bhagvan or His sant, does that mean the avatars of Bhagvan or sant are incapable of granting kalyan? They are indeed capable of granting kalyan. However, a person whose intellect is distorted, always negatively misinterprets things. For example, Shishupal always said, 'The Pandavs are from a different cast. They are immoral because all five of them have the same wife. Krishna is also a scoundrel, because from the moment He was born, He first killed a woman, then He killed a crane, and then He killed a calf. He is known as Madhusudan not because He killed a demon named Madhu, but because he destroyed honeycombs. Just because those Pandavs worship Him, does that make Him Bhagvan?' In this way, Shishupal, with his demonic intellect, identified avgun in Bhagvan and His bhaktas. However, the bhaktas of Bhagvan did not do so in any way. Therefore, a person who perceives avgun should be known to have a demonic intellect."
31.7 Hearing this, Yoganand Muni said, "Maharaj, we do not perceive avgun in the great bhaktas of Bhagvan, but we do perceive avgun in ordinary bhaktas."
31.8 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A bhakta's greatness or smallness is not measured the way you seem to understand it. Greatness is due to a person's nishchay in the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan and by following His agna s. However great a person may be in worldly matters, if he lacks these two characteristics, then he is still ordinary.
31.9 "The greatness which I have just described is present today in all the bhaktas in our satsang. This is because all the bhaktas here realise, 'We have found pratyaksha Purushottam Bhagvan, who is greater than even Akshar. Therefore, we are completely happy'. Realising this, they offer bhakti to pratyaksha Bhagvan, while following His agna s. Therefore, on seeing some irrelevant personal abnormality in such a bhakta, a person should not perceive avgun in him. If a person does have a habit of doing so, then his intellect becomes demonic."

A Bhakta Always Rests In The Murti Of Bhagvan
32.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the morning of Posh vad 3 [3rd January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had tied a white pagh around his head. He had also covered Himself with a white chadar, and His forehead had been smeared with sandalwood paste. He was wearing a garland of white flowers, and a tassel of white flowers was hanging from His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the munis were singing kirtans.
32.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Please listen, I have a question to ask."
32.3 The munis and haribhaktas replied, "Maharaj, please ask."
32.4 After thinking for quite some time, Shree Maharaj said, "In this world, a materialistic individual who is attached to the five vishays, cannot survive without indulging in them. Moreover, just as that vimukh indulges in the five vishays, a bhakta of Bhagvan also indulges in five vishays. So, how are the two different? In what way? Well, the materialistic person enjoys worldly vishays without Bhagvan. However, for a bhakta of Bhagvan, listening to katha s of Bhagvan is the only vishay for his ears; touching the charanavind of Bhagvan or touching the holy dust from the holy feet of a sant is the only vishay for his skin; having darshan of Bhagvan or His sant is the only vishay for his eyes; taking the prasad of Bhagvan and singing His praises are the only vishays for his tongue; and scents of flowers and other objects which have been offered to Bhagvan is the only vishay for his nose. In this way, there is a difference between the vishays that a vimukh indulges in and those that a bhakta indulges in.
32.5 "Furthermore, just as a bhakta cannot stay without indulging in the vishays, even eternally liberated mukta s, such as Narad and the Sanakadik, cannot stay without indulging in them. Although they remain in samadhi for long periods of time, after emerging from samadhi, they also indulge in vishays in the form kathas, kirtans, and talks of Bhagvan.
32.6 "For example, birds leave their nests to gather food, but after gathering their food, they always return to their nests at night to rest. They never forget their own nests and return to another bird's nest. Similarly, after feeding on kathas, kirtans, and talks of Bhagvan, bhaktas of Bhagvan also return to their own nest ( Bhagvan's svarup) to rest. Also, animals, birds, and in fact, all creatures, return to their own homes to rest after feeding. People also travel far and wide for their work, but only when they return to their own home do they rest peacefully.
32.7 "Now, based on the analogies that I have just narrated, I ask all the haribhaktas a question: Just as a vimukh is attached to the five vishays and is unable to live without them for even a single moment, have you becoming firmly attached to the vishays in the form of the kathas, kirtans, and talks of Bhagvan, or not? I also ask another question: Just as a bird returns to its nest after feeding, do all of you also return to rest in your nest ( Bhagvan), after feeding on kathas, kirtans, and talks of Bhagvan? Or, do you rest elsewhere?
32.8 "Additionally, domesticated cattle return to their post in the evening after grazing on the outskirts of the village, whereas stray cattle do not return to their post. A stray cow, after grazing in someone's field, sits wherever it wishes. There, someone may beat it, or it may even be attacked by a tiger. Now, do you return to your post like the domesticated cattle, or do you sit down to rest anywhere after grazing in someone else's field like the stray cattle? Those who are senior amongst you, think about your answer to these questions."
32.9 Then, all the munis and bhaktas replied individually, "Maharaj, we have indeed become attached to kathas, kirtans, and talks related to Bhagvan. Except for the nest and post ( Bhagvan's murti), we do not stay anywhere else." Hearing their reply, Shreeji Maharaj became extremely pleased.
32.10 On that same day, towards the end of the afternoon, Shreeji Maharaj was seated on a large decorated bedstead under the neem tree in the centre of Dada Khachar's darbar, facing the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the munis were singing kirtans.
32.11 Shreeji Maharaj then requested, "Now, please begin a question-answer discussion."
32.12 Dina-Nath Bhatt and Brahmanand Swami asked, "At times, a bhakta of Bhagvan is able to blissfully engage in bhajan and smaran of Bhagvan, and is able to concentrate on His murti. At other times, he is disturbed within and is unable to experience the bliss of bhajan and smaran. What is the reason for this?"
32.13 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "He has not learned the technique of visualising the murti of Bhagvan."
32.14 Hearing this, Muktanand Swami asked, "What is that technique?"
32.15 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The technique is as follows: Different gun enter the antah-karans at different times. When sattva-gun prevails, the antah-karans are pure, and a person can pleasantly engage in bhajan and smaran of Bhagvan's murti. When rajo-gun prevails, the antah-karans become polluted and many disturbing thoughts arise, making it difficult to engage in bhajan and smaran. When tamo-gun prevails, no thoughts arise in the antah-karans at all. Therefore, a person engaged in bhajan should learn to recognise the prevailing gun and should perform dhyan upon the murti of Bhagvan whenever sattva-gun prevails. When tamo-gun prevails, no thoughts arise at all, and a person experiences a feeling of emptiness. A person should not attempt to perform dhyan upon Bhagvan in such conditions. When rajo-gun prevails, many disturbing thoughts arise. Therefore, a person should not attempt to perform dhyan upon Bhagvan at that time either. On such occasions, a person should think, 'I am distinct from these thoughts, and I am an atma. In fact, I am the knower of these thoughts. Furthermore, Purushottam Bhagvan is forever present within me as antaryami'. Only when the force of rajo-gun decreases should a person perform dhyan upon the murti of Bhagvan.
32.16 "However, a person should not become unhappy on noticing the many thoughts which arise when rajo-gun prevails. After all, the antah-karans are like a small child, or a monkey, or a dog, or like a person who plays with a child. The nature of the antah-karans are such that it remains restless for no reason whatsoever. Therefore, a person who wishes to perform dhyan upon Bhagvan should not become disheartened on seeing the disturbing thoughts that arise in the antah-karans. Moreover, the thoughts arising in the antah-karans should be regarded as being distinct from himself. Therefore, a person should engage in the bhajan of Bhagvan, while believing the atma to be distinct from himself."

Blind Faith, Love, And Understanding
33.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Posh vad 5 [5th January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting facing east on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the room next to the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a reto, with deep orange ends, around His head. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
33.2 Muktanand Swami then asked, "The shastras have described countless spiritual activities that please Bhagvan. Amongst them all, which one is so powerful that it alone earns as much bliss of Bhagvan, as is earned by performing all spiritual activities combined? Please reveal it to us."
33.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Please listen as I tell you the one spiritual activity by which Bhagvan can be pleased." He then continued, "Accepting the firm refuge of Bhagvan is the single, greatest activity amongst all spiritual activities for pleasing Bhagvan. However, that refuge must be extremely firm and without any flaws.
33.4 "There are three types of refuge. One way of having the refuge of Bhagvan is with blind faith. If a person has intense blind faith, then even if someone such as Brahma were to attempt to deflect him from his refuge, he would not be deflected.
33.5 "The second type is firm refuge of Bhagvan that is created out of love. Whoever has intense love for Bhagvan, cannot even forcibly be attracted to any object other than Bhagvan. This is known as firm refuge produced out of intense love.
33.6 "The third type is refuge with understanding. A person who has great intelligence understands the sagun- nirgun and anvay- vyatirek aspects of Bhagvan. He understands entities that have been created by Bhagvan's Maya, as well as the ways Bhagvan takes avatars on earth. He also understands how, at the time of creation of the universe, Bhagvan behaves as Akshar, how Bhagvan behaves as Prakruti- Purush, how Bhagvan behaves as Virat- Purush, how Bhagvan behaves as Brahma and other prajapatis. He also understands how Bhagvan works through those like Narad and the Sanakadik, for the purpose of granting kalyan to the jeevs. He understands all these methods.
33.7 "Moreover, he realises that Purushottam Bhagvan is greater than everything and is absolutely unaffected. He who has such an understanding is said to have a firm refuge of Bhagvan using his intelligence. If someone tries to discourage him, or even if he tries to discourage himself, such refuge never fades away. Also, regardless of whether Bhagvan – assuming a human svarup – displays His divine power or acts powerless, such a person's intellect would not hold any doubts."
33.8 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "If you allow me, I wish to ask a question."
33.9 Muktanand Swami replied, "Maharaj, please do ask."
33.10 Shreeji Maharaj then asked, "Of the three characteristics I have just described to you, which is your strength? Although a combination of all three is found in all bhaktas of Bhagvan, the characteristic that is strongest, is said to be the strength they posses. So, of the three – blind faith, love, and understanding – which is your strength?"
33.11 Muktanand Swami and Brahmanand Swami both replied, "Our characteristic is of understanding."
33.12 Then, the other sadhu s also stated their own strengths.

Love Is The Maya Of Bhagvan - Do Not Disobey The agna Of Bhagvan
34.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the morning of Posh vad 11 [11th January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting facing south on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chofal. He had also tied a white pagh around His head, and was wearing garlands of flowers. Tassels of flowers and silken threads were hanging from His pagh, and bunches of flowers had been placed above both of His ears. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the munis were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of musical instruments.
34.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please stop the kirtans, and begin a question-answer discussion."
34.3 Then, Brahmanand Swami asked, "Bhagvan is the cause of all bliss, and He is greater than everything, yet the jeev's vrutti does not become attached to Him. Instead, its vrutti becomes attached to worldly objects that are worthless and perishable. What is the reason for this?"
34.4 Muktanand Swami attempted to give an answer, but was unable to do so adequately.
34.5 So Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please listen as I answer that question. Since the day Bhagvan created this world, He has set it in motion in such a way that he will not have to make an effort again. In fact, He has devised it in such a way that procreation occurs automatically. Men naturally develop affection for women, women naturally develop affection for men, and both naturally develop affection for their children. That is Bhagvan's maya in the form of affection.
34.6 "The vrutti of a person who is not swept away by the flow of that maya, remains focused on the svarup of Bhagvan. So, a bhakta of Bhagvan develops vairagya by maintaining a dislike for worldly objects. Furthermore, knowing Bhagvan to be absolutely blissful, he keeps his vrutti focused on Bhagvan. However, if a person does not develop vairagya towards worldly objects and becomes distanced from the svarup of Bhagvan, then even great mukta s, such as Shiv, Brahma, and Narad, would be swept away by those worldly objects. For this reason, if a person abandons Bhagvan and keeps the company of worldly objects, then his vrutti will most certainly become attached to those worldly objects. Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvan should not keep affection for anything other than Bhagvan."
34.7 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Now, it is Muktanand Swami's turn to ask a question, so please ask."
34.8 Muktanand Swami then asked, "It is extremely difficult for a person to attain Bhagvan. Moreover, there is no greater benefit and no greater bliss than attaining Bhagvan. Then, why do people abandon such immense bliss and struggle painfully for worthless objects? That is the question."
34.9 Shreeji Maharaj said, "Here, I shall answer that. A person suffers when he ignores the agna of Bhagvan and beings to stray away from them. On the other hand, if he acts according to those agna, he will experience the true bliss of Bhagvan. So, a person suffers only to the extent that he disobeys the agna of Bhagvan. Therefore, tyagis should live according to the agna that have been prescribed for tyagi, and grahasthas should live according to the agna that have been prescribed for grahasthas.
34.10 "A person suffers to the extent that he lapses in following these agna. Only when a tyagi follows the eight types of tyag of women, is his vow of brahm-charya considered complete. He suffers to the extent that he deviates from this. Brahm-charya has also been prescribed for grahasthas. For them, brahm-charya constitutes shunning all women except their wives, abstinence from sexual relations with his wife on days of religious occasions, and engaging in sexual relations only during appropriate times. Whoever deviates from these and other niyams that have been prescribed for tyagis and grahasthas, will suffer accordingly.
34.11 "Therefore, the happiness and misery experienced by a vimukh is determined by his own karma s. As for a bhakta of Bhagvan, whatever misery he suffers is due to the negligence in following Bhagvan's agna for the sake of worthless objects. Whatever happiness he does experience, is a result of following the agna of Bhagvan."

Krodh, Man, Irshya, And Kapat Leads To A Demonic Intellect
35.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Posh vad 12 [12th January, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting facing east on a decorated bedstead under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
35.2 Addressing the munis, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Either you ask me a question, or I shall ask you a question."
35.3 The munis said, "Maharaj, please ask."
35.4 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Suppose there is a person who does not falter when it comes to protecting his own kalyan, despite having little intelligence. On the other hand, there is another person who is very intelligent – to the extent that he can point out mistakes even in great men. But, he does not walk on the path of kalyan. What is the reason for this?"
35.5 The munis attempted to answer, but as Shreeji Maharaj raised doubts, they were unable to provide a precise answer.
35.6 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Allow me to answer. Such a person may be highly intelligent, but his intelligence is polluted. As a result, he is unable to walk on the path of kalyan. For example, suppose there is some sweet, tasty buffalo-milk. If a snake's venom were to fall in it, then that milk and sugar would become poisonous. Whoever drinks it, would die. Similarly, such a person may be highly intelligent, but he has identified avgun in a great sant or Bhagvan. The avgun that has entered his mind is equivalent to the snake's venom. So, how can he possibly walk on the path of kalyan? In fact, even if someone were to listen to his talks, the listener's mind would also fall back from satsang.
35.7 "A person possessing such a polluted intelligence in this way, perceives avgun in Bhagvan and His bhaktas, wherever he takes birth. On the other hand, a person who does not have a polluted intelligence, but has little intelligence, does not falter in protecting his kalyan."
35.8 Muktanand Swami then asked, "Maharaj, can a person with such a polluted intellect ever turn towards Bhagvan?"
35.9 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "No, he never turns towards Bhagvan."
35.10 Muktanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, please tell us how we can avoid developing such a demonic intellect."
35.11 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "If a person does not keep the following four svabhavs with Bhagvan and His sant, then his intellect will never become demonic: krodh, man, irshya, kapat. If he keeps even one of these four, then his intellect will become demonic, just like Jay and Vijay. Despite being wise, their intellect became demonic, because they showed man towards the Sanakadik. As a result, they both fell from Vaikunth.
35.12 "Furthermore, when a person's intellect becomes demonic, even the gun of Bhagvan and His bhakta appear as faults to him. Wherever such a person takes birth, he becomes an attendant of Shiv or the king of demons, and does bhajan of Bhagvan with hatred."

A Tyagi Must Only Have Love For Bhagvan
36.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Posh vad 13 [13th January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the platform under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes, with garlands of white and yellow flowers adorning His neck. Bunches of white flowers were placed on both of His ears, and a tassel of yellow flowers was hanging from His pagh. A chhoglu made from red karnikar flowers had also been placed in His pagh. Also, He was playing with a ball of white flowers with His right hand. To the joy of His bhaktas, He was sitting in a charming fashion. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
36.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "How should a person view a person who has abandoned worldly life and accepted the clothing of a tyagi, yet still has affection for useless objects? He should be viewed to be like a poor person beside a wealthy person. Suppose there is a poor person who has no clothes to wear and feeds himself by scavenging for scraps of food from piles of waste, not only does he consider himself to be a sinner, but other wealthy people also consider him to be a sinner. They presume, 'He must have committed many sins, which is why he has no food or clothes'.
36.3 "Similarly, after becoming a tyagi, a person who collects nice clothes and other pleasant objects with a strong craving for them, but does not have affection for dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti, is considered by the great ekantik sant to be a sinner just like the poor person. As he is a sinner, he does not have love for dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti. Instead, he has affection for objects other than Bhagvan.
36.4 "However, for a true tyagi both dirt and gold are equal. Also, a tyagi never makes distinctions by thinking, 'This object is pleasant, and this object is unpleasant'. He never has such an understanding. Instead, he has love only towards Bhagvan. Only such a person is a true tyagi."

Detachment From Birthplace And Relatives
37.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Posh vad 14 [14th January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting facing west on a decorated bedstead under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white pagh, from which hung a tassel of yellow flowers. Bunches of white flowers had also been placed upon both of His ears, and a garland of yellow and white flowers adorned His neck. He had covered Himself with a white chadar, and was wearing a white khes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
37.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A person who lacks understanding cannot abandon his feelings of affection for his birthplace even though he has abandoned the world." So saying, He showed everyone the scar on His thigh where He had been injured by the broken branch of a tree during His childhood. Shreeji Maharaj then continued, "Whenever I see this scar, I remember the tree and the lake. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to forget your birthplace and relatives. I would like those amongst you, who do not remember your birthplace and relations, to confess. For those of you, who do not speak up out of shame, take oath on the name of Nar-Narayan."
37.3 Then, all the munis revealed what was true for them.
37.4 After listening to them, Shreeji Maharaj said, "If a person believes himself to be the atma, where is the birthplace of that atma? Who are the relatives of that atma? Of what gender is that atma? Moreover, if you wish to maintain relationships with your relatives, then you should also maintain relationships with all the relatives that you have had throughout your previous lives in the cycle of 8.4 million life-forms. Furthermore, if a person wishes for the kalyan of his relatives, then he should wish the same for all. However, just as upon beginning this human life the parents of the previous 8.4 million life-forms have all been forgotten due to ignorance, similarly the parents of this human body should be forgotten through knowledge.
37.5 "As for me, I have no affection towards any of my relatives. Moreover, a person may be serving me, but if there is no bhakti for Bhagvan in his heart, I cannot develop a liking for him – even if I try. Even if he is as virtuous as Naradji, if he lacks bhakti for Bhagvan, I do not like him.
37.6 "On the other hand, there is a person who has bhakti for Bhagvan in his heart. He understands that the way in which pratyaksha Bhagvan resides on this earth, and the way in which the bhakta of Bhagvan remains in the vicinity of Bhagvan, is exactly how they remain when atyantik- pralay occurs. He also understands that Bhagvan and His bhakta is eternally sakar, but never does he understand them to be nirakar, regardless of any Vedant shastra he may hear. Furthermore, he realises that no one besides Bhagvan sustains the world, and he also realises that without Bhagvan, even a dry leaf cannot be stirred.
37.7 "A person with such firm belief that Bhagvan is sakar, even an ordinary person, is still dear to me. Kal, karma, and Maya are unable to use their power over him. In fact, Bhagvan Himself instructs any punishment that he is to receive, but no one else has any authority over him. On the other hand, I have no respect for a person without such a belief, even if he happens to have the qualities of tyag and vairagya. However, a person with firm belief in Bhagvan in his heart never loses his belief that Bhagvan is sakar, nor does he ever understand Bhagvan to be nirakar like a mass of light, regardless of how many shastras he may hear or the company he may keep. A sant with such a belief is so highly respected by me that even I place the dust on his holy feet on my head. In my mind, I am afraid of harming him, and I also long to have his darshan.
37.8 "A person without this belief attempts to attain kalyan using the strength of his own spiritual activities, but he does not strive for it by relying on the grace of Bhagvan. Such a senseless person is as foolish as someone wishing to cross the ocean without the aid of a ship, by his own efforts. Conversely, a person who wishes for kalyan through the grace of Bhagvan is wise, like a person who wishes to cross the ocean with the help of a ship.
37.9 "After leaving their body, all those with such knowledge of Bhagvan's svarup attain a murti of chaitanya in the home of Bhagvan and forever remain in His seva in His presence. But if a person has attempted to attain kalyan without having such a belief, then he will go to dwell in the loks of other devs.
37.10 "In fact, the darshan of such a true bhakta of Bhagvan is equivalent to the darshan of Bhagvan Himself. He is so great that his darshan alone can redeem countless wretched jeevs."
37.11 Having delivered these talks, Shreeji Maharaj requested, "Now please sing a kirtan."

Remove Vasna Before You Perform Bhakti
38.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Maha sud 1 [16th January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a small mattress which had been placed on the veranda outside the stables in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had tied a white, red-bordered feto around His head. He was also wearing a richly embroidered angarkhu and had covered Himself with a white chofal. A sabha of sadhu s, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
38.2 After glancing at all the haribhaktas, Shreeji Maharaj thought for some time and then said, "Please listen, as I have something to say."
38.3 He then continued, "From the time a satsangi enters the satsang, he should examine his mind by thinking 'In the first year, my mind was like this, then it was like this. Previously, I had this much desire for Bhagvan and this much desire for the world'. In this way, he should repeatedly reflect on his yearly total of desires and always attempt to gradually, yet constantly eradicate all worldly desires that remain in the mind. However, if he does not assess himself constantly, and allows those desires to accumulate, then they will never be overcome. Consider the analogy of opening an account with a merchant: If a person settles the debts regularly on a monthly basis, then it will not be difficult to repay the debt. But, if he waits until the end of the year to repay the debt, it will be extremely difficult to settle the account. Likewise, a person should assess himself constantly.
38.4 "In reality, the mind is saturated with desires for the world. In the way that sesame seeds are permeated with scent by padding them between alternating layers of flowers, the mind should be saturated with flowers in the form of the constant remembrance of Bhagvan's charitra, together with an understanding of His greatness. These charitras and thoughts of Bhagvan should be entangled within the mind. As one thought subsides, another should be visualised. In this way, the mind should not be left idle." Saying this, Shreeji Maharaj narrated a story of a ghost."
38.5 He then continued, "Even if a person begins to recall the charitras, talks, and darshan of Bhagvan of just one day, there would be no end to them. If that is so, then there would certainly be no end to them for someone who has passed ten to fifteen years in satsang.
38.6 "These charitras should be recalled in the following way: 'In this way, Maharaj and the paramhans held sabha in this village; in this way, puja was offered to Maharaj; in this way, talks were done'. Those charitras of Bhagvan should be recalled over and over again. Moreover, for a person who does not have much understanding, this is certainly the best method for them. In fact, there is no other method like it.
38.7 "Then, you may say, 'We wish to take very little food and wish to keep many fasts'. But, I do not emphasise those methods. A person should abide by those methods as best as he can in accordance with his given niyams. But, what I have just described to you is what should truly be done."
38.8 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I believe that the mind should be free of worldly desires. No matter how much pravrutti a person may do physically, if his mind is pure, then he cannot be seriously harmed – even though outwardly, in society, a person engaged in pravrutti appears to be dishonourable. On the other hand, if a person's mind is full of worldly desires and he superficially behaves as if he is practicing nivrutti, then he may appear respectable in society, but his jeev will suffer severely. This is because at the time of death, it is those thoughts that are in a person's mind that spring forth, just like the child of a deer sprang forth in Bharatji's mind during his last moments. As a result, he became a deer in his next life, even though he had originally given up a kingdom and Rushabh- Dev Bhagvan was his father. Therefore, to remain mentally free of worldly desires is my belief. By keeping fasts, the mind does become weak along with the body; but, when the body becomes strong again, the mind also becomes strong. Therefore, mental tyag is required along with physical tyag. In fact, a person whose mind holds thoughts of Bhagvan but not thoughts relating to the world should be considered important in our satsang. Conversely, those who do not do this are inferior.
38.9 "Furthermore, a grahastha should engage in worldly activities physically, but mentally he should also remain free of worldly desires, just like the tyagi, and should think of Bhagvan. Also, he should engage in social activities according to the agna of Bhagvan. Moreover, if mental tyag is not genuine, then what about Janak Raja, whose mind was like that of a great yog i master, despite ruling a kingdom? Therefore, only tyag which is developed mentally, is appropriate."
38.10 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "If impure thoughts arise in a person's mind, he should reveal them. But, as the saying goes, 'Only a dog will lick a dog's face', or 'When a snake is a guest to another snake, the host-snake will have nothing to offer, so the guest-snake lick's the host-snake's face', or when a married woman goes to a widow, the widow says, 'Come, lady. May you also become like me'. Similarly, to reveal impure thoughts to someone who also experiences impure thoughts is like the examples mentioned.
38.11 "Then, to whom should a person reveal his impure thoughts? Well, he should reveal them to a person who is so strong-willed, that no impure thoughts relating to the world arise in his mind. However, there may be many who do not experience such thoughts. So, out of those, a person should reveal his impure thoughts to a person who criticises those thoughts after listening to them and who continues to criticise them in all of his activities – while eating, drinking, sitting, standing – until they are eradicated from his mind. Moreover, that person should have the same determination to eradicate others' impure thoughts as he has to remove his own. A person should reveal his impure thoughts to such a person. But, if the person to whom he reveals his impure thoughts does not give advice in this way and is himself careless, then what can someone gain from him? Therefore, after revealing impure thoughts in this way and eradicating them, a person should continuously hold thoughts only of Bhagvan and become free from all desires for the pleasures of the world."
38.12 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "What are the characteristics of keeping a fast on a day of Ekadashi? Well, the ten indriyas and the mind, the eleventh, should be withdrawn from their respective vishays and attached to Bhagvan. That is considered as having kept an Ekadashi fast. In fact, bhaktas of Bhagvan should engage in this continuously. In comparison, if a person whose mind is not free from worldly desires in this way physically engages in vrat and tap, he does not benefit very much. Therefore, following his own dharma and understanding Bhagvan's greatness, a bhakta of Bhagvan should maintain a constant effort to free his mind of worldly desires."
38.13 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "A true tyagi is a person whose mind never thinks about a desire for objects that he has already given up. Just as a person has no desire for faeces once they have been excreted, in the same way, no desire arises for rejected objects. Naradji narrated to Shukji: tyaja dharmama-dharma cha. The essence of the shlok is: 'A person should abandon all objects except the atma; he should behave only as the atma and worship Bhagvan'. Such a person can be called a perfect tyagi. Furthermore, grahastha haribhaktas should behave like Janak Raja, who said, 'Although my city of Mithila is burning, nothing of mine is burning', as stated in the following shlok: mithilayam pradeep-tayam na me dahyati kinchana: A grahastha haribhakta with this type of understanding, even though he may possess a house, is a true haribhakta. A person who is not such a tyagi or grahastha is called a false bhakta, whereas a person who behaves as described above should be known as an ekantik bhakta."
38.14 Then, Mota atmanand Swami asked Shreeji Maharaj, "What are the characteristics of the jeevatma, which is distinct from the body, the indriyas, the antah-karans, and their presiding devs?"
38.15 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "I shall answer that question in brief. The jeev is the speaker that explains the nature of the body and the indriyas, and explains their natures separately to the listener. That speaker is the knower of everything, and is distinct from all the above – that is called the jeev. Also, the listener, which understands the forms of the body and the indriyas as being distinct, which knows them, and which is distinct from them all, is also known as the jeev itself. This is the method of understanding the nature of the jeev." Shreeji Maharaj spoke in this way.

Nirvikalp Or Savikalp Samadhi
39.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Maha sud 3 [18th January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the platform under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had tied a white pagh around His head, from which tassels of yellow flowers were dangling. Bunches of white and yellow flowers had been placed above His ears, and He was wearing garlands of yellow flowers around His neck. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
39.2 Shreeji Maharaj then asked a question to a vedanti brahman who was sitting in the sabha, "You claim that only Brahm exists. Furthermore, you say that with the exception of that Brahm, jeevs, ishvars, Maya, the world, the Veds, six- shastras, and the Purans, are all false. I can neither understand this concept of yours, nor can I accept it. Therefore, please answer what I ask you, and do so by citing only the Veds, the six- shastras, the Purans, the Smrutis, or other historical shastras. However, if you reply quoting the words of some inauthentic shastra, then I will not accept your answer. But, since I have absolute faith in the words of Vyasji, I will be able to accept your answer if you reply quoting his words."
39.3 The vedanti then attempted to reply using various arguments, but as Shreeji Maharaj had raised doubts, the question remained unanswered.
39.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please listen as I answer that question myself. There are two different states of those who have become mukta s by worshipping Bhagvan. For example, a person standing on top of Mount Meru clearly sees everything in the vicinity of Meru – the other mountains, trees, as well as the ground that supports the mountains and the trees. Similarly, those enlightened mukta s who have attained savikalp samadhi, see jeevs, ishvars, Maya, and their supporter ( Brahm), as being separate from each other. A person standing on top of Mount Loka-Lok, sees everything in the vicinity of Mount Loka-Lok, but sees the other mountains and trees, as being one with the ground. He does not see them as being separate. Similarly, those great mukta s who have attained nirvikalp samadhi see jeevs, ishvars, and Maya as Brahm, but they do not see them as separate entities.
39.5 "In this way, there are two differing states of mukta s, and it is due to their differing states that everything is viewed as being either satya or asatya. The words of those who have attained the savikalp state are noted in the Veds, the six- shastras, and the Purans, and they describe all of those entities as being satya. However, the words of those who have attained the nirvikalp state describe all of those entities as asatya. In reality, they are not asatya. They are only described as being asatya because they cannot be seen due to the influence of the nirvikalp state.
39.6 "For example, there is no night for a person sitting in the chariot of Surya. But, for those on earth, there is both day and night. Similarly, from the viewpoint of a person who has attained the nirvikalp state, all the things do not exist, whereas according to others, they do exist. So, if a person interprets ' Brahm' in this way, then there will never be any irregularities in the statements of the shastras. But, if a person does not, then irregularities will arise. Furthermore, if a person – without having understood these inconsistencies and without having attained that nirvikalp state, relying solely on words learned from the shastras – promotes the existence of Brahm alone, claiming that the guru, the shishya, jeevs, ishvars, Maya, the world, the Veds, the Purans, and the shastras, are all imaginary, then he is extremely foolish. Ultimately, such a person will be sent to Narak."
39.7 Having answered the question, Shreeji Maharaj ended by asking the brahman, "Now, if you have any doubts in what I have just said, please say so."
39.8 Then, the vedanti brahman replied, "O Maharaj, O Prabhu, O Swami! You are Bhagvan, and you have incarnated for the kalyan of the entire world. The explanation you have given is of course precise. There is no room for any doubt." So saying, he became extremely pleased, and after abandoning his misconceptions, he became an ashrit of Shreeji Maharaj.

The Characteristics Of Bhakti And Upasana
40.1 In the Samvat year 1876, in the early hours of Maha sud 4 [19th January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had tied a white pagh around His head, with a tassel of yellow flowers hanging from it. He was wearing a garland of yellow flowers around His neck. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
40.2 Muktanand Swami then asked Shreeji Maharaj, "What is savikalp samadhi, and what is nirvikalp samadhi?"
40.3 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "If a person who has sthiti in the svarup of Bhagvan does not have any impure desires, but does have some pure desires. For example, 'I wish to become like Narad, the Sanakadik and Shukji', or 'I wish to go to the ashram of Nar-Narayan and stay with the munis there to perform tap', or 'I wish to go to Shvet-Dvip and become like a mukta of Shvet-Dvip by performing tap' – then such a person is said to be in savikalp samadhi. On the other hand, a person who does not have such thoughts, has attained the characteristics of Akshar- Brahm, and remains engaged only in the murti of Bhagvan, is said to be in nirvikalp samadhi."
40.4 Then, Muktanand Swami asked again, "Maharaj, what is the difference between bhakti and upasana?"
40.5 Shreeji Maharaj replied: shravanam kirtanam vishnoha smaranam pad-sevanam archanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atma-nivedanam : Nine ways of offering bhakti to Bhagvan: shravan, kirtan, smaran , pad sevan, archan, vandan, dasya, sakhya, atma-nivedan. "To worship Bhagvan in these nine ways is known as bhakti.
40.6 "Upasana can be defined as having a firm belief that Bhagvan's svarup is sakar. Even if a person becomes brahm-rup, that belief never disappears. Moreover, even if he happens to listen to shastras proposing the view that Bhagvan is nirakar, he would still understand Bhagvan to always be sakar. Regardless of what is mentioned in the shastras, he would only promote Bhagvan's svarup as sakar, never allowing his own upasana to be disproved. A person who has such a firm understanding is considered to possess upasana."

Purushottam Bhagvan Resides In All
41.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Maha sud 5 [20th January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the platform under the neem tree near the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. He was also wearing garland of yellow flowers. Bunches of yellow flowers had been placed above His ears, and tassels of yellow flowers were dangling from His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
41.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please engage in a question-answer discussion."
41.3 Nrusinhanand Swami then said, ekoham bahu shyam prajayeya : "Many pandits and vedantis in the world interpret this Vedic shlok to mean: 'The one Bhagvan present at the time of destruction, Himself takes the form of all jeevs and ishvars by His own will'. But this belief can only be accepted by someone who is a fool. We have accepted your refuge, so this belief does not make sense in our minds. Our understanding is that Bhagvan is achyut, and that he does not divide and assume the svarups of various jeevs and ishvars. Therefore, we can only fully understand the meaning of this shlok if you explain it to us."
41.4 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "The meaning of that Vedic shlok is not as they interpret it to be. In fact, it has a different meaning altogether. In the Ved-Stuti, it is stated: svakruta-vichitra-yonishu vishan-niva hetutaya taratam-tash-cha-kastyanala-vatsva krutanu-krutihi. This means: 'Purushottam Bhagvan creates and enters the various types of life-forms as their cause, He is antaryami, and He inspires them to a greater or lesser degree'.
41.5 "More specifically, at the time of creation, Purushottam Bhagvan, who is greater than even Akshar, looks towards Akshar. As a result, Purush incarnates from Akshar. After entering Akshar, Purushottam enters Purush, and in the form of Purush, inspires Prakruti. In this way, as Purushottam successively entered the various entities, the activities of creation took place. Then, Pradhan- Purush were produced from Prakruti- Purush. From Pradhan- Purush, maha-tattva was produced. From maha-tattva, the three types of ahankar were produced. From ahankar, the bhuts, the vishays, the indriyas, the antah-karans, and their presiding devs were produced. From those, Virat- Purush was produced, and from the lotus extending from his naval, Brahma was produced. From that Brahma, Marichi and other prajapatis were produced. From them, Indra and other devs, the demons, and all the sthavar and jangam creatures were produced.
41.6 "Purushottam Bhagvan enters and dwells in all the above as their cause, and is antaryami. However, He does not reside in Prakruti- Purush to the extent that He resides in Akshar. He does not reside in Pradhan- Purush to the extent that He resides in Prakruti- Purush. He does not reside in maha-tattva and the rest of the twenty-four tattvas to the extent that He resides in Pradhan- Purush. He does not reside in Virat- Purush to the extent that He resides in the twenty-four tattvas. He does not reside in Brahma to the extent that He resides in Virat- Purush. He does not reside in those like Marichi to the extent that He resides in Brahma. He does not reside in Kashyap to the extent that He resides in Marichi. He does not reside in Indra and the other devs to the extent that He resides in Kashyap. He does not reside in human beings to the extent that He resides in Indra and the other devs. He does not reside in animals and birds to the extent that He resides in human beings. In this way, Purushottam Bhagvan resides in all – to a greater or lesser degree – as their cause, and is antaryami.
41.7 "For example, fire resides within wood. Large fire resides in large pieces of wood, long fire resides in a long piece of wood, and bent fire resides in a bent piece of wood. In a similar way, Purushottam Bhagvan resides in various entities with varying degrees of power according to the task to be accomplished through that entity.
41.8 "Purushottam Bhagvan also resides in those like Akshar and Prakruti- Purush, and is antaryami. However, because of the difference in the abilities of those entities, there is a difference in their power. So, there is only one Purushottam Bhagvan, and it is He who enters all and resides in them as antaryami. But, He Himself does not become the jeevs and ishvars by assuming many svarups. This is how that Vedic shlok should be interpreted."

Gadhada I – 42
Vidhi And Nishedh
42.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Maha sud 6 [21st January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting facing west on a decorated bedstead on the platform under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He had tied a white pagh around His head. He had also covered Himself with a white chadar and was wearing a white khes. Bunches of yellow flowers had been placed above both of His ears. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
42.2 Seated in the sabha, were some vedanti brahmans. Seeing them, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Those who study or listen to the Vedant shastras claim, 'The vidhi and nishedh are false; Svarg and Narak, which are attained by following them, are also false; the disciples who attain them are false; and the guru is false as well. Brahm pervades everything and it alone is satya'. But, those who speak in this way, with what understanding do they propose this?
42.3 "In actual fact, the acharya of all vedantis, Shankar-acharya, had his own disciples keep a cane and a kamandalu. He also enforced, ' A person should recite the Bhagvad Geeta and the Vishnu-Sahasranam; a person should perform puja of Vishnu; those who are young should bow down to those who are senior in age; and a person should beg for alms only from the house of a religious and pure brahman'. So, because Shankar-acharya proposed the following of various vidhi and nishedh in this way, can you claim that he did not have complete gnan? Have those who claim to have recently attained gnan, and have falsified the following of these vidhi and nishedh, become greater than Shankar- acharya? Actually, it seems as if they are speaking out of absolute foolishness.
42.4 "In reality, those vidhi and nishedh that have been falsified in the shastras, can be understood through the following example: If a large ship sets out to sea for a year, then neither the shoreline ahead nor the shoreline behind can be seen. In fact, even huge mountains on either shoreline cannot be seen, so how can trees or people possibly be seen? Wherever a person looks, only water can be seen; but besides water, nothing else is visible. If he looks up, the enormous waves of the ocean rising up will be seen. So even above, only water is visible. In this situation, people sitting in the ship would claim that there is only water, and nothing else exists. The principle behind this example is that a person who has attained a nirvikalp state in the form of Brahm claims, 'There is only Brahm; besides that everything else, such as jeevs, ishvars, and Maya, is false'. Hearing words written in the shastras supporting this view, a person who has not even attained that state, claims all vidhi and nishedh are false. He thinks of his wife and children, and carries out all social activities while believing them to be true. Therefore, he believes the vidhi and nishedh, which are written in the shastras, to be false. Those who preach such gnan in this world should be known as extremely sinful and nastiks.
42.5 "After all, it was because of the uneasiness that such a nastik nature may creep into people's hearts, that Shankar-acharya composed many shloks in the praise of Vishnu, such as: bhaja govindam bhaja govindam govindam bhaja mudhamate O fool! Worship Bhagvan...Worship Bhagvan...Worship Bhagvan. "He also composed several shloks praising Shivji, Ganpati, Surya, and many other devs. After hearing these shloks, all the devs appear to be satya. It was with this intention in mind that Shankar-acharya composed shloks in praise of all these devs. Despite this, scholars of today falsify them. In addition, they claim, 'Regardless of how severe a sin a person with gnan may commit, it would not affect him'. But, they say this out of foolishness.
42.6 "Also, consider this: From all those tyagi paramhans, Jadbharat is the best. In fact, the story of Jadbharat has been noted in each of the Purans and all the Vedant shastras. That great Jadbharat was also the son of Rushabh- Dev Bhagvan in his previous life. He gave up his kingdom, and went to live in the forest. There, he developed affection for a deer. Although that was merely out of compassion, this mistake caused him to be reborn as a deer. Like that deer, he attained four legs, a short tail, and small horns on his head.
42.7 "In comparison, the gopis of Vraj were attached to Shree Krishna Bhagvan out of lust. Despite this, they were still able to overcome Bhagvan's maya, and attain the nirgun Akshardham of Bhagvan after becoming gunatit. The reason for this was that Shree Krishna Bhagvan was Purushottam, and He was a gunatit divya murti. So, because the gopis developed love for Him, either knowingly or unknowingly, they became gunatit as well. However, Bharatji became a deer because he had developed affection for the deer out of compassion. Therefore, no matter how great a person may be, kusang only leads to harm. Conversely, regardless of how great a sinner a person may be, if he maintains profound association with Bhagvan, who is satya, then that person also becomes absolutely pure and attains kalyan. Of course, if Shree Krishna Bhagvan was not gunatit himself, then His bhaktas, the gopis, would not have attained the gunatit state. But, because they did attain the gunatit state, Shree Krishna Bhagvan was most certainly flawless, gunatit, and divya.
42.8 "Vedantis also claim, 'Everything is pervaded by Brahm'. Just as the gopis developed love for Shree Krishna Bhagvan, all women develop love for their husbands, and all men develop love for their wives. However, they do not attain what the gopis attained. Instead, they attain gloomy Narak. Therefore, those who prescribe that vidhi and nishedh are indeed true, not false; and whoever falsifies them, will be consigned to Narak."
42.9 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj bid "Jay Sachidanand" to everyone, and returned to His residence.

Gadhada I – 43
The Four Types Of Mukti
43.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Maha sud 7 [22nd January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He had tied a white pagh around His head. He had covered Himself with a white chadar and was wearing a white khes as well. Tassels of yellow flowers were dangling from His pagh, and garlands of yellow flowers adorned His neck. Also, bunches of yellow flowers had been placed above both of His ears. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
43.2 Looking at all the bhaktas with a compassionate gaze, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I wish to ask a question, so please listen." He then began, "The Shreemad Bhagvat Puran states, 'Those who are bhaktas of Bhagvan do not desire any of the four types of mukti'. Other great bhaktas of Bhagvan also say, 'Bhaktas of Bhagvan do not wish for the four types of mukti'. What are the four types of mukti? The first type is to reside in the dham of Bhagvan; the second type is to stay near Bhagvan; the third type is to assume a svarup similar to Bhagvan; and the forth type is to attain powers similar to Bhagvan. These are the four types of mukti. A bhakta of Bhagvan does not wish for any of these. Instead he only wishes to serve Bhagvan. Now, my question is, 'Why does that bhakta not wish for the four types of mukti?' Please answer according to your ability."
43.3 All the paramhans attempted to answer the question, but were unable to do so adequately.
43.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Here, I shall answer the question. A person who maintains a desire for the four types of mukti after becoming a bhakta of Bhagvan is known as a 'sakam bhakta'. In contrast, a person who has no desires regarding the four types of mukti, and who only desires to serve Bhagvan, is known as a ' nishkam bhakta'. In fact, the Shreemad Bhagvat states: mat-sevaya prateetam cha salokyadi chatushtayam nechhanti sevaya puranaha krutonyat-kalaviplutam : If those who are only fulfilled by serving me do not desire the four types of mukti, such as a place in my dham, which are attained by serving me – then why would they desire anything that is ultimately perishable? salokya sarshti sameepya sarupyaika-tvamapyut deeyamanam na gruhnanti vina mat-sevanam janaha : Even if granted a place in my dham, powers similar to mine, my closeness, a svarup similar to mine, or oneness with me, nishkam bhaktas would not accept them without my seva.
43.5 "This means that a nishkam bhakta of Bhagvan does not wish for the four types of mukti, if the seva of Bhagvan is not included. He only wishes to serve Bhagvan. In turn, Bhagvan keeps this nishkam bhakta in His own seva. Bhagvan also insists on granting such a bhakta with His divine powers and bliss, even though the bhakta does not wish for them. Kapil-Dev Bhagvan has also said: atho vibhutim mama maya-vinasta-maishvaryam-ashtangama-nupravruttam shriyam bhagavateem va spruhayanti bhadram parasya me teshnuvate tu loke : Even though my nishkam bhaktas have no wish for the material wealth of the loks up to and including the lok of Brahma, for the eight extraordinary powers, or for the auspicious wealth of Bhagvan, they still enjoy all these in my dham.
43.6 "In the Geeta, such a nishkam bhakta has been referred to as a bhakta with gnan. A sakam bhakta, on the other hand, has been referred to as materialistic. Therefore, a bhakta should not wish for anything except the seva of Bhagvan. After all, wishing for anything other than the seva of Bhagvan is considered to be a flaw. It should be overcome by extreme association with the nishkam ekantik bhakta of Bhagvan."

The Characteristics Of Love
44.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the morning of Maha sud 8 [23rd January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting facing west on a decorated bedstead on the platform under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes, and had covered Himself with a white chadar. Also, He had tied a white feto around His head, and had tied a bokani with one end of the feto. A garland of white flowers decorated the feto. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
44.2 Shreeji Maharaj then asked, "What is the characteristic of having love towards Bhagvan?"
44.3 Brahmanand Swami attempted to describe the characteristic of love, but was unable to do so adequately.
44.4 Hearing his reply, Shreeji Maharaj commented, "You have not even come close to describing love. You say it is remaining detached from the body and the brahmand, but that is not the characteristic of love. That is the characteristic of vairagya. In actual fact, love is constantly remembering Bhagvan's murti. That is called love.
44.5 "A bhakta with total love for Bhagvan, never has any thoughts other than those of Bhagvan. The extent to which he holds desires other than those of Bhagvan, is the extent to which he lacks in his love. If, whether knowingly or unknowingly, some thoughts other than remembering Bhagvan's murti were to arise in a person who has true love for Bhagvan, it would be as distressful for him as someone throwing a handful of pebbles and sand into a delicious meal he is eating, or as painful as being branded on his forehead by a red-hot branding iron. A person who feels this way should be known to have love for Bhagvan. So now, if all of you examine your hearts, you will realise how much love you have for Bhagvan."
44.6 Brahmanand Swami then asked, "By what means can a person develop such intense love for Bhagvan?"
44.7 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Only by keeping profound association with the sat-purush can a person develop intense love for Bhagvan."
44.8 At this point, Somla Khachar questioned, "But, we are intensely engaged in such profound association, yet why does such intense love not develop?"
44.9 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "It is true that you engage yourselves in such profound association, but as well as associating with me, you also associate with the world. As a result, intense love for Bhagvan does not develop."
44.10 Then, a brahman named Valo Dhruv, from Vaso, asked a question. "Maharaj, how can the feelings of 'I-ness' and 'my-ness' towards the body and its relations, be eradicated?"
44.11 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The jeev has a misconception that it does not believe itself to be the jeevatma, and distinct from the body. Instead, it believes itself to be the body. To illustrate how the body clings to the jeevatma, consider a person who wears a dagli after having it sewn by a tailor. That person then begins to believe, 'The tailor is my father, and the tailor's wife is my mother'. Such a person would be considered a fool. In the same way, the jeevatma is given a dagli in the form of this body. That body is born sometimes to a brahman couple, or sometimes to a low-caste couple, or in any of the other 8.4 million life-forms. Therefore, a person who believes the body to be his true self and believes the parents of that body to be his own parents, is called a fool. He should be considered to be like an animal.
44.12 "Moreover, out of those 8.4 million life-forms previously undertaken, there is not a single mother, sister, daughter, or wife who keeps the pati vrata vow any longer. So, how can a person who believes these relations to be his true relations, ever overcome the feelings of 'Iness' and 'my-ness'? Therefore, without such understanding, to eradicate attachment for a person's birthplace and native land, is very difficult indeed.
44.13 "Therefore, as long as a person believes the body to be his true self, his entire understanding is totally useless. As long as he continues to hold pride in his varna and ashram, he will never see qualities of a sadhu. So, after discarding the feelings of 'I-ness' and 'my-ness' for the body and its relations, believing the atma to be brahm-rup, and after abandoning all worldly desires, if a person worships Bhagvan while following svadharma, he should be known as a sadhu. No distance remains between Purushottam Bhagvan and a person who has acquired such qualities of a sadhu. Everything else may be possible, but to acquire such qualities of a sadhu is extremely difficult. In fact, I am such a sadhu, because I do not have even the slightest pride in my varna and ashram."
44.14 Shreeji Maharaj spoke in this way for the purpose of enlightening His bhakta. In reality, He Himself is Purushottam Narayan.

Bhagvan Is Sakar And The Light Is Nirakar
45.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Maha sud 10 [24th January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting facing south on the platform in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a white pagh around His head. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
45.2 Gopalanand Swami then asked, "Maharaj, many vedantis claim that Bhagvan is nirakar, and does not possess a svarup. Moreover, they quote Vedic shloks that support only that belief. On the other hand, bhaktas of Bhagvan, such as Narad, Shukji, and the Sanakadik, claim that Bhagvan is sakar. Of the two, who is correct?"
45.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Purushottam Bhagvan is eternally sakar, and that murti is extremely luminous. The all-pervasive Brahm, which is antaryami and sachidanand, is actually the divine light of Purushottam Bhagvan, but He Himself possesses a definite murti. The Shrutis also mention, 'Bhagvan looked towards Maya'. Now, if Bhagvan sees, does that mean that He has only a pair of eyes and nothing else? He also has hands and feet. This proves that He is sakar.
45.4 "Take the example of water. Its corresponding dev, Varun, is sakar in his own home, while water itself is described as nirakar. Also, the flames of a fire are described as nirakar, while their corresponding dev, Agni, is sakar in his own home. Sunlight is also described as being nirakar, while Surya- Dev, who resides in his home, is sakar. Similarly, sachidanand Brahm is nirakar, while Purushottam Bhagvan is sakar. Furthermore, that all-pervasive sachidanand Brahm, is the divine light of Purushottam Bhagvan.
45.5 "Someone may claim that the Shrutis propose that Bhagvan is all-pervasive and perfect, and is without features like hands and feet. But, those Vedic shloks that disprove the features like hands and feet, are actually disproving the mayik hands and feet. In reality, Bhagvan's murti is divya, not mayik.
45.6 "When a mirror is placed in front of the sunlight, the reflection is just like the sunlight. In this way, the light of Purushottam Bhagvan, which is sachidanand Brahm and pervades everything, can also be seen as sakar, like Purushottam Bhagvan, by the pure antah-karans acting like a mirror.
45.7 "In the same way, Purushottam Bhagvan is always sakar. He is not nirakar. Those who do believe Him to be nirakar, just do not understand."

The Creation And Destruction Of akash
46.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Maha sud 11 [25th January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting facing south on the platform near the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a white pagh around His head. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
46.2 Then, a vedanti brahman by the name of Maheshvar Bhatt asked Shreeji Maharaj, "Everything is merged during the state of samadhi, but how does akash become merged?"
46.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Please listen carefully as I explain the characteristics of akash in detail. akash is the name given to vacant space. All objects that exist, reside only within that vacant space. Moreover, akash pervades and resides within all of those objects. In fact, there is not a single object in which there is no akash. It even exists in the smallest particle of pruthvi. If we cut that particle into millions of pieces, akash will exist within those pieces as well.
46.4 "So, when a person looks from the viewpoint of akash, the other four bhuts cannot be identified; only akash can be identified. Everything is dependent on that akash. The three types of bodies, sthul, sukshma, and karan, stay within akash. This brahmand also resides within akash, along with its creator, Prakruti and Purush. But that akash also resides within Prakruti- Purush and their creations, the body and the brahmand. akash resides externally as their supporter. Therefore, this akash is never merged, neither during the state of sushupti nor during samadhi.
46.5 "Someone may argue, 'The five bhuts have evolved from tamo-gun, so how can that akash be called the supporter of Prakruti and Purush? Also, how can it be said to pervade them all?' Well, if Prakruti did not contain akash in the form of vacant space, then how could maha-tattva – which emerges from Prakruti in the way fruits and flowers emerge from a tree, and a calf emerges from a cow's womb – emerge at all? Therefore, akash does reside within Prakruti. Furthermore, ahankar also emerges from maha-tattva, so akash resides within maha-tattva as well. The three gun emerge from ahankar, so akash resides within ahankar as well. The five bhuts emerge from tamo-gun, so akash resides within tamo-gun as well. However, the akash that has evolved from tamo-gun is subject to change, whereas the akash that is the support of everything is not subject to change and is eternal. It is this akash that is known as Brahm and as Chidakash, and is the supporter of all. Moreover, it is within this akash that Purush and Prakruti undergo the states of expansion and contraction.
46.6 "How is this so? When Purush gazes at Prakruti – just as children are born to a man and woman – with Purush as the husband and Prakruti as the wife – children in the form of maha-tattva are produced. In this way, Prakruti takes the form of the twenty-four tattvas as well as the form of the body and the brahmand. This is her state of expansion. Purush pervades all entities that evolve from that Prakruti, with his powers. This is his state of expansion.
46.7 "In time, when all the entities that have evolved from Prakruti are destroyed, and Prakruti appears to remain absorbed in Purush's body, that is Prakruti's state of contraction. When Purush reverts within his own self – at the time when all the entities that have evolved from Prakruti are destroyed – that is known as Purush's state of contraction. For example, when a tortoise expands, all of its limbs emerge from its shell; and when it contracts, it withdraws all of its limbs back into its shell and remains totally motionless. That states of expansion and contraction of Prakruti and Purush are similar to this.
46.8 "Also, it is only Purush, and not the all-supporting Chidakash, which has an anvay- vyatirek relationship with Prakruti and the entities evolved from her. After all, how can something that is all-supporting ever be vyatirek from anything? On the contrary, Purush always resides in everything.
46.9 "This brahmand is surrounded on all four sides by the Loka-Lok mountains, just like a fort. Beyond the Loka-Lok mountains is alok; beyond alok are the seven barriers; beyond that is nothing but darkness; beyond that darkness, there is divine light, which is known as Chidakash. Above, the brahmand extends up to Brahm-Lok; above which are the seven barriers ( jad prakruti); above which there is darkness ( Maya); above which there is again divine light, which is known as Chidakash.
46.10 "Below, brahmand extends down to the seventh Patal; below which are the seven barriers ( jad prakruti); below which there is darkness ( Maya); below which there is again divine light, which is known as Chidakash. In this way, Chidakash is present on all four sides of the brahmand, as well as within the brahmand. When a person's vision reaches the perspective of that all-supporting Chidakash, it is given names like dahar- vidya or akshi-vidya. However, they are all called brahm-vidya.
46.11 "That Chidakash is extremely luminous and eternal. It is neither created nor destroyed. Whenever there is any mention of the creation and destruction of akash, it is with reference to the akash that has evolved from tamo-gun, and which is full of darkness. This akash can be merged, but the all-supporting Chidakash is never merged. This is the answer to your question. If anyone still has any doubts please do ask."
46.12 Then, the vedanti brahman and all the haribhaktas replied, "None of us have any doubts at all now."

Characteristics Of Dharma, Bhakti, Gnan, And Vairagya
47.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the morning of Maha sud 12 [26th January, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the platform under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
47.2 Then, after snapping the fingers of His right hand, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Everyone please listen with attention, as I have something to tell you. What I have to say is simple, but you will only be able to grasp its meaning if you listen carefully. Otherwise, you will not."
47.3 All the haribhaktas said, "Please do tell us, Maharaj."
47.4 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Of Bhagvan's bhaktas, some have strength in dharma- nishtha, some have strength in atma- nishtha, some have strength in vairagya- nishtha, and some have strength in bhakti- nishtha. Although a person may have one strength, they also possess all the other types, but to a lesser extent.
47.5 "A bhakta, whose main strength is following bhagvat- dharma, lovingly engages himself in performing the basic seva of Bhagvan and His bhaktas. He also abides by the rules, like ahinsa and brahm-charya, which are related to the dharma of his varna and ashram. The bhakta also enjoys building mandir s for Bhagvan, and working in His gardens. He enjoys offering different varieties of food to Bhagvan, and also enjoys hand-plastering and sweeping the mandir s of Bhagvan and the residential halls of sadhu s. In addition, he offers bhakti to Bhagvan by listening to kathas and singing kirtans without any form of pretence. Moreover, such a bhakta who is strong in following dharma intensely enjoys listening to and reading shastras describing bhagvat-dharma.
47.6 "A bhakta, whose main strength is atma- nishtha, always behaves as the atma, which is beyond the three bodies and the three mental states, and is described as eternal. He understands that his ishta-dev, pratyaksha Shree Krishna Paramatma, is beyond everything, has an extremely pure svarup, and forever possesses a divya murti. In addition, he talks about and listens to talks describing the pure nature of his own atma, as well as talks about Paramatma. He also enjoys shastras that contain such talks. His nature is such that he is unable to tolerate anything that obstructs him from behaving as an atma.
47.7 "A bhakta, whose main strength is vairagya- nishtha, has a persistent dislike for all worldly objects, but not towards Bhagvan's murti. Realising those objects to be asatya, he never remembers his home, his family, or any other object that he has given up – in the same way that he never remembers faeces once they have been excreted. Such a bhakta only keeps the company of bhaktas who are tyagis. In addition, he offers bhakti to Bhagvan in a way that does not conflict with his tyag. His talks are always about tyag, and he has a liking for shastras that propose tyag. Moreover, he has an extreme dislike for tasty foods, beautiful clothes, and for all worldly objects related to the five vishays that may interfere with his tyag.
47.8 "A bhakta, whose main strength is bhakti- nishtha, has intense love only for Bhagvan's svarup. Apart from that svarup of Bhagvan, he is unable to focus his mind's vrutti towards worldly objects. Yet, he lovingly offers rich clothes and jewellery to Bhagvan. He also enjoys listening to the human-like charitras of Bhagvan and also greatly enjoys listening to any shastra that describes Bhagvan's svarup. In addition, he only develops love towards those bhaktas who have love for Bhagvan. Besides them, he never develops love towards even his own son or relatives. Such a bhakta is always engaged in some activity that is related to Bhagvan.
47.9 "Now, after reflecting upon this talk, which describes the characteristics of bhaktas possessing these four strengths, all of you please reveal which of these is your strength. In actual fact, this talk is rather like a mirror, as it reveals a person's own true strength as it is. Furthermore, those who are Bhagvan's bhaktas are never without a strength. However, as they may have not recognised it, they find that they cannot intensify it. As long as it is not strengthened, it will continue to fluctuate according to the talks a person hears. So, after thinking over this talk, please reveal your strengths as they are."
47.10 All the haribhaktas then revealed their respective strengths.
47.11 Shreeji Maharaj then requested, "Those who have similar strengths, please stand up together." Then, those bhaktas with similar strengths, stood up in turn, after which Shreeji Maharaj asked all of them to sit down again.
47.12 Nityanand Swami then asked, "Do those four types of bhaktas, with their strengths, have any gun or avgun in their strengths?"
47.13 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Yes, they do have gun and avgun. Please listen as I describe them. The extent to which bhaktas with those four strengths behave according to the characteristics I have described earlier, is their gun. The extent to which they cannot behave according to those characteristics, is their avgun."
47.14 Finally, Muktanand Swami asked, "Of the four types of bhaktas, is one superior to the others, or are they all equal?"
47.15 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "As long as each one adheres to his strength, then all four are equal. However, if a person adheres to all four strengths, then he is superior to all. When one person is strong in all four, he is known as param-bhagvat, and only he can be called an ekantik bhakta."

Protection Against The Four Types Of Kusangis
48.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Maha sud 13 [27th January, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting facing west on a decorated bedstead on the platform under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Two oil-lamps were lit in front of Him after the sandhya arti of Shree Vasudev-Narayan, and the Narayan dhun had finished.
48.2 After that, Maharaj said "Everyone listen very carefully. I wish to speak to you."
48.3 Then, the munis and haribhaktas said, "Maharaj, please tell us."
48.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "It is my wish, that all haribhaktas receive a murti of Nar-Narayan Dev printed on paper, for you to perform puja. This puja is accepted by all shastras. The Shreemad Bhagvat states that there are eight types of murtis, including a printed murti. Therefore, puja can be performed upon a printed murti. This is my wish.
48.5 "In the morning, all haribhaktas should bathe and then perform puja of Nar-Narayan. Then, you should do pradakshina and sashtang pranam. Then, you should ask, 'Please protect me from the influence of kusangis'."
48.6 Shreeji Maharaj then elaborated, "There are four types of kusangis: the kuda- panthis, the shakti- panthis, the shushka- vedantis, and the nastiks. If a person associates with kuda- panthis, they will cause him to falter in his vartmans and make him impure. If a person associates with shakti- panthis, he will be forced to consume meat and alcohol, which will deflect him from following his svadharma. If a person associates with a shushka- vedanti, a person will fall from bhakti and upasana, because such people claim that the dham of Bhagvan and the murti Bhagvan are all false. Finally, if a person associates with nastiks, they promote that only karmas are real, and deny the existence of Shree Krishna Bhagvan, and therefore leads a person astray from the path prescribed by the eternal, sacred shastra.
48.7 "Therefore, a person should request from Bhagvan, 'May I never encounter the company of these four types of people'. He should also pray, 'Maharaj. Please protect me from the inner enemies of kam, krodh, lobh, moh, ahankar, irshya, and the belief that I am the body. Also, forever keep me in the company of your bhaktas'. A person should daily pray to Bhagvan in this way, and always be wary of such kusangis and inner enemies.
48.8 "All haribhaktas should not think, 'How can the picture on the paper protect us from kusang?' A person should never bring this thought into the mind. If all of you listen to me and perform the puja of Nar-Narayan, I can communicate with Nar-Narayan, as I am a sat-purush. I will say to Nar-Narayan, 'Maharaj. Please remain in the murti that I have given, if the haribhaktas abide by the panch-vartman, and perform puja of the murti'.
48.9 "I will keep Nar-Narayan Dev by force in the murti, and tie him with a rope in the form of love. So, please keep faith that the murti on paper is truly Nar-Narayan Dev. Knowing this, never leave a murti without having performed puja. In the morning, after bathing, you should perform puja of Bhagvan. Then, you should attend to your daily duties. As long as you follow the panch-vartman, and perform puja of Nar- Narayan Dev, He will remain in this murti. This is my agna, which you all should believe with firm faith."
48.10 The haribhaktas accepted everything that was said by Shreeji Maharaj.

Gadhada I – 49
Antar-Drashti
49.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Maha sud 14 [28th January, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the platform under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. Two small oil lamps were lit in front of Him. He was wearing a garland of yellow flowers around His neck, and strings of yellow flowers decorated both wrists. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
49.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Please begin a question-answer discussion."
49.3 Then, Brahmanand Swami asked, "Why is it that our vrutti remains on Bhagvan only as long as we forcibly keep it there, whereas it remains on worldly objects without the slightest effort?"
49.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The vrutti of Bhagvan's bhakta never remains on anything except Bhagvan. In fact, his only concern is 'It will be very difficult for me to keep my vrutti on worldly objects'. Therefore, Bhagvan's bhakta finds it difficult to keep his vrutti on any worldly objects, while a worldly person finds it difficult to keep his vrutti on Bhagvan. A person whose vrutti does not remain fixed on Bhagvan, is not a bhakta of Bhagvan. Nevertheless, if he attends satsang, he will gradually become a bhakta by listening to the talks of the sadhu s."
49.5 Brahmanand Swami then asked further, "By what means can a person keep his vrutti on Bhagvan?"
49.6 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The way to achieve that is antar-drashti. Antar-drashti is to constantly look towards the murti of pratyaksha Bhagvan that a person has attained. Besides that murti, even if he sees the six chakras, or Golok, or Vaikunth, or other dhams of Bhagvan, it should not be considered to be antar- drashti. Therefore, to look at Bhagvan's murti that a person has seen within his heart, or to look at the murti of Bhagvan visible externally, is known as antar-drashti. However, wherever a person's vrutti strays apart from Bhagvan's murti, it is called bahya-drashti."
49.7 Shreeji Maharaj then told the paramhans, "Please arrange yourselves into pairs, and begin a question-answer discussion."
49.8 Then, the paramhans carried out a question-answer discussion amongst themselves for quite some time, through which Shreeji Maharaj examined their intelligence.

A Person With A Sharp Intellect
50.1 In the Samvat year 1876, in the early hours of Maha vad 1 [31st January, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in front of the veranda outside Dada Khachar's medi in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
50.2 Shreeji Maharaj then asked the munis, "A person who possesses a sharp intellect attains Brahm. Can the intellect of a person who is skilled in the managing of worldly affairs be called sharp, or not? Also, can the intellect of a person who is very skilled in interpreting the shastras and the Purans be called sharp, or not?"
50.3 The munis attempted to answer the question, but were unable to do so adequately.
50.4 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "Some people may be extremely skilled in worldly affairs, yet they do nothing at all to safeguard their own kalyan. Others know the precise meanings of the various shastras, Purans, and other historical shastras, yet they too do nothing to safeguard their kalyan. Therefore, they cannot be said to possess a sharp intellect. Instead, they possess a blunt intellect. On the other hand, a person who safeguards his kalyan, even though he may possess only a limited intellect, should be considered to have a sharp intellect. So, a person who pays more attention to worldly affairs, even though he possesses a sharp intellect, should be considered to possess a blunt intellect.
50.5 "This is stated in the Bhagvad Geeta: ya nisha sarva-bhootanam tasyam jagrati sayami yasyam jagrati bhutani sa nisha pashyato munehe" This shlok explains that while worshipping Bhagvan, all worldly people behave as if their mind is covered in darkness, like the night.Therefore, they do not worship Bhagvan. On the other hand, Bhagvan's bhaktas are awake in worshipping Bhagvan. Therefore, they are constantly engaged in worshipping Bhagvan. Furthermore, everyone's mind is awake with respect to the five vishays – shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh – and they continuously indulge in the vishays. In contrast, the minds of the Bhagvan's bhaktas, are covered in darkness with regards to indulging in the vishays. Therefore, they do not indulge in them.
50.6 "Therefore, only a person who remains alert regarding his own kalyan can be said to possess a sharp intellect. As for others, they are all mere fools."

Nishchay In Bhagvan Can Only Be Developed Through Bhagvan
51.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the night of Maha vad 2 [1st February, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white surval and a white angarkhu. He had also tied a white pagh around His head. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
51.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please ask a question."
51.3 Purnanand Swami then asked, "The ten indriyas are produced from rajo-gun, and the four antah-karans are produced from sattva-gun. Therefore, all the indriyas and antah-karans are mayik. However, Bhagvan is beyond Maya. So, how can a person develop nishchay in Bhagvan through the mayik antah-karans? Also, how can a person see Bhagvan with his mayik indriyas, like the eyes?"
51.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Mayik objects can be realised by mayik means, and if a person has realised Bhagvan through the same mayik antah-karans and indriyas, then it implies that Bhagvan must also be mayik. Is that your question, or not?"
51.5 Purnanand Swami and all the munis confirmed, "Yes Maharaj. That is our question. You have clarified it for us."
51.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The answer to that is as follows: The surface area of the pruthvi is 500,000,000 yojans. On the pruthvi, there are various objects such as trees, mountains, pots, and clothes. That pruthvi exists within all of those objects, and it also exists distinctly on its own. So, if a person looks from the perspective of pruthvi, then it appears that pruthvi has taken the form of all of those objects, and that no object exists apart from pruthvi. However, pruthvi itself has been produced from a small portion of jal. This jal is below the pruthvi, around it, as well as above it. In fact, jal totally pervades the pruthvi. If a person looks from the perspective of jal, only jal exists, and there is no pruthvi at all. Furthermore, that jal has been produced from a small portion of tej. If a person looks from the perspective of tej, only tej exists, and there is no jal at all. This tej, has been produced from a small portion of vayu. If a person looks from the perspective of vayu, only vayu exists, and there is no tej at all. This vayu has been produced from a small portion of akash. If a person looks from the perspective of akash, the other four bhuts, the entities evolved from them (the body and the brahmand) are not apparent at all. It appears as if only akash exists everywhere.
51.7 "This akash has been produced from a small portion of tamas- ahankar. That tamas- ahankar, along with rajas-ahankar, sattvik- ahankar, the bhuts, the indriyas, and antah-karans, and their presiding devs, have been produced from a small portion of maha-tattva. So, if a person looks from the perspective of maha-tattva, the three types of ahankars, the bhuts, the indriyas, the antah-karans, and their presiding devs, do not exist – only maha-tattva exists. So, if a person looks from the perspective of maha-tattva, the three types of ahankars, the bhuts, the indriyas, the antah-karans, and their presiding devs, do not exist – only maha- tattva exists. That maha-tattva has been produced from a small portion of Pradhan-Prakruti. Therefore, if a person looks from the perspective of Prakruti, maha-tattva does not exist – only Prakruti exists. However, during the period of destruction, Prakruti is absorbed into a small portion of Purush, and at the time of creation, she is produced again from a small portion of Purush. Therefore, if a person looks from the perspective of Purush, only Purush exists – there is no Prakruti.
51.8 "Countless millions of Purush are produced from a small portion of Maha-Maya. So, if a person looks from the perspective of Maha-Maya, only Maha-Maya exists – there is no Purush. Maha-Maya itself is produced from a small portion of Maha-Purush. So, if a person looks from the perspective of Maha-Purush, only Maha-Purush exists – there is no Maha-Maya. That Maha-Purush, rose from a small region of Akshar – the dham of Purushottam Bhagvan. Therefore, if a person looks from the perspective of Akshar, neither Maha-Purush nor anything else exists – there is only Akshar. But, above that Akshar is Purushottam Bhagvan, who is even greater than Akshar. That Purushottam Bhagvan is that all-doer – responsible for the creation, sustenance, and destruction of everything – and is also the cause of all.
51.9 "Now, a cause always pervades its effect, and at the same time, also remains distinct from it. Therefore, if a person looks from the perspective of Purushottam Bhagvan, the cause of all, then nothing else appears to exist – except Purushottam Bhagvan.
51.10 "It is this very Bhagvan who, out of compassion for the kalyan of the jeevs, gives darshan in a pratyaksha svarup to all the people on this earth. At that time, if a person realises this greatness of Purushottam Bhagvan by intense association with a sant, then all of his indriyas and antah-karans become divya, just like Purushottam Bhagvan's indriyas and antah-karans. Then, through those indriyas and antah-karans, he can develop nishchay in Bhagvan. For example, a diamond can only be cut by another diamond; it can never be cut by anything else. Similarly, the nishchay in Bhagvan can only be developed through Bhagvan. In the same way, the darshan of Bhagvan is also possible only through Bhagvan, but it is not possible through the mayik indriyas and antah-karans."
51.11 Having delivered this talk, Shreeji Maharaj bid "Jay Sachidanand" to all and returned to His residence.

Realising Bhagvan Through The Four Shastras
52.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Maha vad 3 [2nd February, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was having katha read on the veranda outside Dada Khachar's medi in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
52.2 During the katha, a reference was made to the fact that a person who understands Bhagvan's svarup through the four sets of shastras – Sankhya, Yog, Vedant, and Panch-Ratra – should be known to be completely enlightened.
52.3 Hearing this, Muktanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, please explain how a person can realise Bhagvan through those four sets of shastras? Also, what deficiency remains in a person who does not realise Bhagvan in that way?"
52.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The Sankhya shastras propose Bhagvan as being the twenty-fifth tattva. Also, just as the twenty-four tattvas are incapable of doing anything without Bhagvan, jeev and ishvar are also incapable of doing anything without Bhagvan. Therefore, jeev and ishvar are also included in the twenty-four tattvas. These twenty-four tattvas, which include jeev and ishvar, are called kshetra. Bhagvan, the twenty-fifth tattva, is called kshetragna.
52.5 "The Yog shastras propose Bhagvan as being the twenty-sixth tattva, and as possessing a definite murti. They describe jeev and ishvar as the twenty-fifth tattva, and describe the twenty-four tattvas as being distinct from them. They prescribe that a person should perform dhyan upon Bhagvan, realising his atma to be distinct from those tattvas.
52.6 "The Vedant shastras describe Bhagvan as pervading all, as being the cause of all, as the supporter of all, as nirgun, advait, and niranjan, and as the non-doer despite being the all-doer. They also describe Him as possessing only divya qualities and not any worldly qualities.
52.7 "The Panch-Ratra shastras describe that there is only one Bhagvan, who is Shree Krishna Purushottam Narayan. He incarnates into the four svarups of Vasudev, Sankarshan, Aniruddha, and Pradyumna. It is also He who assumes an avatar on this earth. A person who offers the nine types of bhakti to Him, attains kalyan.
52.8 "These are the various descriptions of Bhagvan as given in those four scriptures. A person who thoroughly understands them, should be known to be completely enlightened.
52.9 "However, a discrepancy would arise if a person were to try to understand Bhagvan's svarup using only the Sankhya shastras, while leaving the other three shastras aside. The Sankhya shastras do not describe jeev and ishvar as being distinct from the twenty-four tattvas. Therefore, when the followers of Sankhya reject the twenty-four tattvas and believe their jeevatma to be distinct from them, they would understand their jeevatma as the twenty-fifth tattva, but not Bhagvan.
52.10 "There is a weakness in trying to understand Bhagvan's svarup from the Yog shastras alone. They believe that Bhagvan possesses a definite murti, but the followers of Yog consider Him to have limitations. They do not understand Him to be the antaryami of all, and absolutely perfect.
52.11 "There is also a weakness in trying to understand Bhagvan's svarup from the Vedant shastra alone. They believe that Bhagvan – who is the cause of all, pervades all, and is nirgun – is nirakar. They do not realise that Bhagvan's eternal svarup possesses divya limbs, not mayik arms and legs.
52.12 "There is also a weakness in trying to understand Bhagvan's svarup from the Panch-Ratra shastras alone. They offer bhakti to Bhagvan, but they see Bhagvan's avatars with human traits. Also, they understand Bhagvan to be present in only one place at any one time, and not as being the antaryami of all and absolutely perfect.
52.13 "These are the types of weaknesses that arise when a person does not realise Bhagvan using a combination of all four sets of shastras. However, if a person attempts to realise Bhagvan using all four sets of shastras together, then the weakness raised from the understanding of one set of shastras, is corrected by the understanding of another. Therefore, a person who understands Bhagvan using all four sets of shastras, is known as being completely enlightened.
52.14 "If he ignores one set of shastras, he is known as being three-quarters enlightened. If he ignores two sets of shastras, he is known as being half-enlightened. If ignores three sets of scriptures, he is known as being a quarter enlightened. If he acts according to his own fictional interpretations of the shastras while ignoring all four sets of shastras, then even if he is a vedanti or a person with upasana, he is lost. He cannot be said to have found the path of kalyan. Therefore, such a vedanti's gnan is hypocritical, and a person with such upasana is a hypocritical bhakta."

Progression And Regression In Satsang
53.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Maha vad 9 [8th February, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting facing west on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white surval and a white angarkhu. He had tied a rich, orange shelu with a silken border around His waist. He had also tied a rich, orange reto with a silken border around His head, with tassels of flowers hanging from it. He was also wearing garlands of flowers around His neck. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
53.2 Shreeji Maharaj then requested, "Someone please ask a question."
53.3 Muktanand Swami then asked, "There are those in satsang who progress day by day. There are also those who seem to fall back day by day, despite being in satsang. What is the reason for this?"
53.4 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "A person who perceives avgun in a great sadhu, gradually falls back in satsang. Conversely, a person who perceives gun in that sadhu progresses, and his bhakti towards Bhagvan flourishes. Therefore, a person should not perceive avgun in a sadhu. Instead, should only perceive his gun.
53.5 "A person should perceive an avgun in that sadhu only if he breaks any of the vartmans prescribed by Bhagvan. However, even if the sadhu has no flaws in following his vartmans, on seeing some small irregularity in the sadhu's nature, a person may feel that is improper. Therefore, they focus only on the sadhu's avgun, and ignore his many gun. This causes the person's own glorious gun, like of gnan and vairagya, to diminish.
53.6 "Therefore, only if there is a flaw in the following of the vartmans, should a person find avgun; he should not find avgun in a bhakta of Bhagvan for any other reason.
53.7 "Moreover, if a person does not find flaws, his glorious gun will begin to flourish day by day."

Upholding Bhagvat-Dharma - The Gateway To Moksh
54.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Maha vad 11 [9th February, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with an orange reto that had a border of interlocked golden and silver threads. He had also tied a feto around His head using a sky-blue silken cloth. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
54.2 Muktanand Swami then asked, "Through the discussion between Janak Raja and the nine Yogeshvars, the eleventh skandh of the Shreemad Bhagvat describes the nature of a bhagvat-dharma. How is the bhagvat-dharma sustained? Also, how can the gateway to moksh be opened for the jeev?"
54.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Bhagvat-dharma is sustained by maintaining intense love towards an ekantik sadhu of Bhagvan, who possesses the qualities of svadharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti coupled with knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness. Maintaining intense love towards such a sadhu also opens the gateway to moksh for the jeev. Kapil-Dev Bhagvan has said to Devhuti: prasanga-majaram pasha-matmanaha kavayo viduhu sa eva sadhushu kruto moksha-dvarama-pavrutam" This means: 'If a person maintains intense love towards an ekantik sant of Bhagvan just as strongly as he maintains intense love towards his own relatives, then the gateway to moksh is open for him'."
54.4 Shuk Muni then asked, "By what characteristic can someone recognise a person who would never lapse in following his dharma, even under the most difficult circumstances?"
54.5 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person whose nature is such that he is strict in obeying the agna of Bhagvan, and who would never disobey any agna, however minor or major, will never fall back from following dharma, irrespective of the circumstances. Therefore, determination in dharma is found only in those who strictly follow Bhagvan's agna, and their satsang also remains strong."

Bhajan, Smaran, Vartman
55.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Maha vad 11 [10th February, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on the east-facing veranda of His own residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sants, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
55.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please begin a question-answer discussion."
55.3 Muktanand Swami then asked, "Why is a person unable to remain determined in bhajan, smaran, and the vartmans?"
55.4 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "A person's determination does not remain steady due to the influence of unpleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang. There are three levels of this determination: uttam, madhyam, and kanishth. If there are extremely unpleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang, then even the uttam level determination is dissolved. Then, what can be said of the madhyam and kanishth levels of determination?
55.5 "However, if a person's determination remains exactly the same, despite the influence of extremely unpleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang, then the force of good deeds and merits previously performed by him must be extremely powerful. On the other hand, a person's intellect may become polluted despite extremely pleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang. This is because he must have committed a great sin, or must have insulted a great bhakta of Bhagvan, either in a past life or in this life. Therefore, despite association with pleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang, his mind has still become polluted.
55.6 "If a person serves a great sant attentively, his sins will be burnt and reduced to ashes. On the other hand, if a person associates with a great sinner, then his own sins increase, and any religious deeds that he may have performed, will also be destroyed. Also, a person who puts his arms around the necks of prostitutes drinking alcohol, and then blames Bhagvan by thinking, 'Why did Bhagvan not keep my mind stable?' should be known as an utter fool."

A Bhakta With Gnan - Knowledge Of The atma - Upasana
56.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Maha vad 12 [11th February, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes, and had covered Himself with an orange reto, interlaced with gold and silver threads. He had also tied a reto, with a deep orange border, around His head. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. After singing the 'Narayan' dhun, some munis were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a jhanjh and mrudang.
56.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Please conclude singing kirtans, and let us conduct a question-answer discussion for a while." Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Let me ask a question."
56.3 He then began by saying, "Shree Krishna Bhagvan mentions four types of bhaktas in the Geeta. Of these, the bhaktas with gnan are described as being the best. However, if all four have an equal level of nishchay in Bhagvan's svarup, how is the bhakta with gnan superior?"
56.4 The munis attempted to answer that question, but were unable to give a satisfactory answer.
56.5 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "The bhakta possessing gnan behaves as brahm-svarup and thoroughly realises the greatness of Bhagvan. As a result, no desires remain in his mind except for those of Bhagvan's svarup. However, the other three types of bhaktas do not fully realise the greatness of Bhagvan, despite having nishchay in Bhagvan. This means that desires, other than those for Bhagvan, still continue. That is why they do not come equal to those bhaktas possessing gnan. Therefore, if any desires, other than those related to Bhagvan, remain in a bhakta, it is a serious flaw.
56.6 "Another major flaw is when a person who has no worldly desires at all and has intense vairagya, behaves arrogantly on account of that vairagya. Also, he may have the intense force of knowledge of the atma, or may have the force of intense bhakti towards Bhagvan. However, if out of arrogance, he is unable to bow before humble bhaktas or is unable to address them humbly, then that is also a serious flaw in him. As a result of that flaw, his strength in satsang does not flourish.
56.7 "Consider the analogy of a stone-cutter digging a well. If the stone underneath sounds hollow when he strikes it, he predicts, 'There will be plenty of water in this water-well'. However, if the stone sounds solid on the surface, and sparks fly when he strikes it, then the stone-cutter assumes, 'If there is going to be any water in this water-well at all, there will be very little'. In the same way, a person who remains arrogant due to the pride of his gnan, vairagya, and bhakti, may be called great, but his greatness will be very limited, as he does not perceive the gun of humble bhaktas. Therefore, whoever wishes to please Bhagvan should not become arrogant due to the pride of his gnan, vairagya, and bhakti, or due to any other glorious gun he may have. As a result, pratyaksha Shree Krishna Narayan will become pleased, and will reside in his heart."
56.8 Muktanand Swami then asked, "Maharaj, by which method can a person overcome the pride which arises due to gnan, vairagya, bhakti, and other glorious gun?"
56.9 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "While realising the greatness of Bhagvan's bhaktas, if he physically bows down to them, serves them, recognises thoughts of pride when they arise in his heart, and maintains the force of thought, then pride is eradicated."
56.10 Shreeji Maharaj then continued, "A bhakta's great, loving bhakti for Bhagvan may be so intense, that Bhagvan does as that bhakta wishes. However, if that bhakta develops pride in his heart due to that bhakti, it presents a serious flaw on his part. Also, a bhakta may be arrogant due to his knowledge of the atma or due to his vairagya, but that arrogance only serves to strengthen his belief of being the body. Therefore, bhaktas of Bhagvan should not hold on to any form of pride whatsoever. That is the only means to please Bhagvan.
56.11 "Furthermore, if great bhaktas of Bhagvan examine themselves and look inwards towards their own hearts when even a little pride arises, they would notice an expression of disgust on the murti of Bhagvan residing within their hearts. Conversely, when they behave humbly, Bhagvan's murti residing within their hearts would appear to have an extremely pleased expression. Therefore, using the force of thought, a bhakta of Bhagvan should not allow any sort of pride to arise.
56.12 "However, if pride does exist with gnan, vairagya, and bhakti, it is rather like impurities added to gold. If impurities are added to twenty-four carat gold, it becomes twenty-two carat. Adding more impurities renders it eighteen-carat. Adding even more impurities renders it twelve-carat gold. In the same way, as impurities (pride) mix with that bhakta's gnan, vairagya, and bhakti, the purity of all three gradually decreases. Therefore, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti without pride, are like twenty-four carat gold.
56.13 "If a person is arrogant, the qualities of gnan, vairagya, and bhakti may make him appear virtuous from the surface, but he does not have any inner-strength. For example, this pruthvi, with a surface area of 500,000,000 yojans, supports the oceans, the mountains, and all forms of life, and so it appears very strong. However, because the pruthvi floats on jal like a dung-cake, jal appears to be much stronger than pruthvi. Likewise, tej appears to be much stronger than jal, and vayu appears to be even stronger than tej. Finally, although it appears to have no strength at all, akash is the strongest of them all since it supports all the other four. Similarly, the qualities of gnan, vairagya, and bhakti of a bhakta who has no pride, are as powerful as akash. He may not outwardly appear to be powerful, but such a humble bhakta is superior to all.
56.14 "Moreover, just as a child never has any feelings of pride, in the same way, no matter how much praise or respect he encounters, a sadhu should always behave without pride – just like a child."
56.15 Muktanand Swami then asked another question: "The jeev is distinct from the indriyas, antah-karans, and prans. It is also distinct from the three mental states of jagrat, svapna, and sushupti, and the three bodies of sthul, sukshma, and karan. After hearing this in satsang, a firm belief of this has been developed. So why does the blissful jeevatma, while engaged in the bhajan and smaran of Paramatma, still associate with the indriyas, antah-karans, prans, the three mental states, and the three bodies, causing it to become miserable due to the influence of disturbing thoughts?"
56.16 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Many people become siddh, many become sarvagna, and many become devs. Therefore, they attain countless types of greatness, including Akshardham. All this is achieved through the force of the upasana of Bhagvan, and without upasana nothing can be accomplished. Therefore, the distinction between atma and non- atma cannot be realised by merely understanding the distinction as given in the shastras, nor can it be realised by listening to talks from senior sadhu s and deciding in the mind, 'I shall now distinguish between atma and non- atma'. Instead, it is the extent of a person's nishchay in his ishta-dev that determines how much distinction he develops between atma and non- atma. In fact, without using the strength of his ishta-dev, no spiritual activities can be fulfilled.
56.17 "In contrast, a person who has loving bhakti for Bhagvan, like the gopis, has completed all spiritual activities. However, if a person does not have such love, then he should understand the greatness of Bhagvan in the following way: 'Bhagvan is the master of Golok, Vaikunth, Shvet-Dvip, and Brahm-Mahol. Although He appears to be like a human for the purpose of granting happiness to His bhaktas, His murti in His dhams like Golok and Vaikunth, radiates with the brilliance of millions and millions of suns from each part of His body. However, in Mrutyu-Lok, humans serve Him, and He becomes visible only when a small oil lamp is lit in front of Him. Nonetheless, it is He who provides light to those like the sun and the moon. That Bhagvan is such that Radhika, Lakshmi, and His other bhaktas constantly serve Him in His dhams. Following the destruction of the brahmands, it is only this pratyaksha Bhagvan who remains. Also, it is this same Bhagvan who, at the time of creation, creates countless millions of brahmands through Prakruti and Purush'.
56.18 "Thinking of Bhagvan's greatness in this way, is the only method for understanding the distinctions between atma and non- atma. In addition, the extent of that bhakta's nishchay in Bhagvan, coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness, also determines the amount of vairagya that develops in that bhakta's heart. Therefore, after abandoning the dependence on the strength of other spiritual activities, a person should rely exclusively on the strength of Bhagvan's upasana.
56.19 "Such a bhakta believes, 'However great a sinner a person may be, if at the end of his life, he utters 'Swaminarayan', he will be redeemed of all sins and will reside in Brahm-Mahol. Then, how can there be any doubt about a bhakta, who has taken refuge in that Bhagvan, attaining the dham of Bhagvan?' That is how he understands the greatness of Bhagvan. Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvan should increase the strength of their upasana of Bhagvan day by day, by practicing satsang."

The Most Extraordinary Method To Attain Moksh
57.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fagan sud 2 [15th February, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in the residential hall of the sadhu s in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sadhu s, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
57.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Those of you who know how to engage in a question-answer discussion, may ask one question each."
57.3 Muktanand Swami then asked, "Maharaj, what is the most extraordinary means of attaining moksh?"
57.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The knowledge of Bhagvan's svarup and the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness are the two most extraordinary means to attain moksh."
57.5 Muktanand Swami then asked another question, "What is the nature of love towards Bhagvan?"
57.6 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "The nature of true love is that it should not be developed by logical thinking. However, if a person develops love by logically thinking of Bhagvan's gun, then perceiving avgun in Bhagvan will cause his love to be broken. Therefore, it is best to leave such love as it was originally, rather than repeatedly establishing it and then raising doubts about it. Instead, a person should develop love towards Bhagvan with blind faith. After all, love developed by logically thinking of Bhagvan's gun cannot be trusted. Therefore, a person should develop the same type of love towards Bhagvan as he has for his bodily relations. This love is known as love due to blind faith. However, having said this, love developed by realising Bhagvan's greatness is of a totally different nature altogether."
57.7 Shivanand Swami then asked, "Although a person has an intense yearning to stay in the satsang, why is it that some inappropriate svabhav s are still not eradicated?"
57.8 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "If a person has not developed a dislike for the svabhav that is holding him back in satsang, how can he be said to have an intense yearning for satsang? And how can he be said to have realised that svabhav to be his enemy? For example, if a friend of yours were to kill your brother, your friendship with him would no longer remain. Instead, you would be prepared to cut off his head. This is because the relationship with a brother is closer than that with a friend. Likewise, a person may have a svabhav that causes him to break his vartmans and fall from satsang. Despite this, if he still does not have any feeling of hatred towards it and does not develop bitterness towards it, then he does not have total love for satsang. On the other hand, if his love for satsang is like the love he has for his brother, then he would shun that negative svabhav immediately. After all, the jeev is extremely powerful. The mind and indriyas are all merely the kshetra, whereas the jeev is their kshetragna; the jeev can achieve whatever it attempts."

The Body, Kusang, And Past Sanskars
58.1 In the Samvat year 1876, at the time of the sandhya arti on Fagan sud 5 [18th February, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in the residential hall of the paramhans in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
58.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Please ask a question."
58.3 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, when a bhakta of Bhagvan engages in bhajan and smaran of Bhagvan, he is disturbed by the forces of rajo-gun and tamo-gun in his heart. As a result, he is unable to experience the bliss of bhajan and smaran. So, how can a person overcome the force of rajo-gun and tamo-gun?"
58.4 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The influence of the gun is due to three factors – the body, kusang, and past sanskars. Of these, the gun that arise due to the body are overcome by reflecting upon the atma and the non- atma. Gun that have arisen due to kusang are eradicated by keeping the company of a sadhu. Should these two methods fail to eradicate the force of rajo-gun and tamo-gun, then the problem lies in the influence of some unpleasant sanskars of the past; they are very difficult to eradicate."
58.5 anandanand Swami then asked, "How can such unpleasant sanskars of the past be eradicated?"
58.6 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "If an extremely great sant becomes pleased upon a person, then regardless of how unpleasant the person's sanskars may be, they are all destroyed. Moreover, if a great sant is pleased, a beggar can become a king. No matter how unpleasant a person's prarabdha may be, it becomes pleasant. Also, he avoids any terrible hardships that lie ahead."
58.7 anandanand Swami asked further, "How can a person please such a great sant?"
58.8 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "First of all, he must be honest with a great sant. He must also abandon kam, krodh, lobh, moh, mad, matsar, asha, trushna, ahankar, and irshya. Moreover, he should behave as a das of a sant, and maintain a constant effort to eradicate pride from his heart. While doing so internally, he should physically continue to bow to everyone as well. As a result, the great sant will become pleased with him."
58.9 Mahanubhavanand Swami then asked, "Maharaj, while staying in satsang, how can a person eradicate all of his faults? Also, how can a person's bhakti towards Bhagvan continue to flourish day by day?"
58.10 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The more a person continues to perceive the gun of the great sant, the more his bhakti begins to flourish. If he realises the truly great sant to be completely nishkami, then even if he has as much kam as a dog, he will also become nishkami. Conversely, if he perceives the avgun of kam in the great sant, then no matter how nishkam he may be, he becomes full of intense kam. In the same way, if a person views the great sant to be full of krodh or lobh, then he will also become full of krodh and lobh. Therefore, if a person understands the great sant to be absolutely free of kam, lobh, svad, man, and sneh, he will also become free of all of those evil natures and become a faithful bhakta.
58.11 "What are the characteristics of such a faithful bhakta? Well, just as he has a natural dislike for objects that cause misery, similarly he has a natural dislike for the attractive five vishays ( shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh). Moreover, he has firm nishchay in Bhagvan alone. Such a person should be known as a faithful haribhakta.
58.12 "The only way of becoming such a faithful bhakta, is by behaving as a das of the das of Bhagvan, and by realising, 'All these bhaktas are great, and I am inferior compared to them all'. Realising this, he behaves as a das of the bhaktas of Bhagvan. All the evil natures of a person who behaves in this way are destroyed; and day by day, glorious qualities , such as gnan, vairagya, and bhakti, continue to flourish within him."

Unique Love For Bhagvan
59.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fagan sud 14 [27th February, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting facing west on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a white cloth, with a border of silken thread, around His head. His forehead had been smeared with sandalwood paste. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
59.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Please begin a question-answer discussion."
59.3 Muktanand Swami then asked, "Maharaj. How can unique love towards Bhagvan be developed?"
59.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person should have the following understanding: Firstly, the belief of Bhagvan – 'He who I have attained is undoubtedly Bhagvan Himself'. He should also have the attributes of an astik. Furthermore, he should realise the divine powers of Bhagvan – 'This Bhagvan is the master of Brahm-Mahol, Golok, Shvet-Dvip, and all other dhams. He is the master of countless millions of brahmands and is the all-doer'. He should never believe Purush, Kal, karma, Maya, the three gun, the twenty-four tattvas, or Brahma and the other devs, to be the creators of this brahmand. Instead, he should realise only Purushottam Bhagvan to be the creator, and the antaryami of all. Such an understanding, along with nishchay in pratyaksha Bhagvan, is the only way to develop a unique love for Bhagvan."
59.5 Muktanand Swami asked further, "Despite having realised the greatness of Bhagvan, why does a person still not develop a unique love for Bhagvan?"
59.6 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "If he has realised the greatness of Bhagvan in this way, then he indeed does have a unique love for Bhagvan, but he does not realise it. For example, Hanumanji possessed immense strength, but he did not realise it until someone else revealed it to him. Also, when Baldevji abducted Pralamb-asur, Baldevji possessed tremendous strength, but he himself was unaware of this fact. He only became aware of his strength when he was informed by a divine voice from the sky. In the same way that bhakta does indeed have unique love for Bhagvan, but he is simply not aware of it."
59.7 Muktanand Swami asked further, "How can the strength of the love be realised?"
59.8 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "A person realises that he has a unique love for Bhagvan, by practicing satsang and by listening to the sacred shastras."
59.9 Muktanand Swami then asked another question. "Desh, kal, and kriya become either pleasant or unpleasant. Is this due to sang, or due to some other factor?"
59.10 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "All desh are a part of the earth, and so they are the same everywhere. Kal is also the same everywhere. However, wherever there is an extremely powerful person, unpleasant desh, unpleasant kal, and unpleasant kriya, all become pleasant by his influence. Conversely, by associating with an extremely vile sinner, even pleasant desh, pleasant kal, and pleasant kriya, become unpleasant. Therefore, the person is the governing factor in determining whether desh, kal, and kriya are pleasant or unpleasant.
59.11 "If that person is extremely powerful, he will influence desh, kal, and kriya, according to his nature, throughout the whole world. A person of slightly less power will be able to influence only one region. A person who is even less powerful will be able to influence only one village. A person of even less power than that will be able to influence only a neighbourhood or his own household. In this way, the pleasant and unpleasant influences of desh, kal, and kriya are dependent upon the purity and impurity of these two types of people."

Following Ekantik Dharma - Eradicating Worldly Desires
60.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fagan vad 1 [29th February, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in the residential hall of the paramhans in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a white pagh around His head, which was decorated with tassels of white flowers. Garlands of white flowers were hanging around His neck. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
60.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Of all spiritual activities, the activity of eradicating worldly desires, is the greatest. A person can do this by bearing in mind his craving for the vishays – shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh – and by thinking, 'Is my desire for Bhagvan equal to my desires for the world? Is it greater? Or is it less?' A person should examine himself in this way. For example, if a person's ears are drawn to worldly talks just as much as they are drawn to talks related to Bhagvan, then he should realise, 'My desire for Bhagvan is equal to my desire for the world'. He should examine all the other vishays in this way.
60.3 "While examining himself in this way, if a person gradually decreases his worldly desires and increases his desire for Bhagvan, he begins to develop an understanding where he views all vishays equally. After such calmness has developed, honours and insults will appear to be the same to him. Moreover, pleasant and unpleasant types of touch will appear to be the same; attractive sights and unattractive sights will appear to be the same; a girl, a young lady and an old woman will appear to be the same; gold and rubbish will appear to be the same as well. Similarly, pleasant and unpleasant tastes and smells will also appear to be the same. When a person can instinctively behave in this way, it should be known that his worldly desires have been overcome.
60.4 "In fact, to behave above the influence of worldly desires, is the dharma of a person who is ekantik. But, if some desires do remain, then even in a person is able to attain samadhi and control his nadi and prans, those desires will draw him back out of samadhi. Therefore, only a person who overcomes worldly desires is an ekantik bhakta."
60.5 Muktanand Swami then asked, "What are the means to eradicate worldly desires?"
60.6 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Firstly, a person requires firm atma- nishtha. Secondly, he should realise the insignificance of the five vishays. Thirdly, he should realise the profound greatness of Bhagvan, and think, 'Bhagvan is the master of all dhams – Vaikunth, Golok, Brahm-Mahol. So, having attained that Bhagvan, why should I have affection for the pleasures of the vishays, which are useless?' A person should think of Bhagvan's greatness in this way.
60.7 "He also thinks, 'If I become unworthy of going to the dham of Bhagvan, due to some deficiency remaining while worshipping Bhagvan, and He were to place me in Indra-Lok or Brahm-Lok, there is still a million-fold more bliss there, in comparison to this world'. With such a thought, a person should become free of all desires for the insignificant pleasures of the world. So, by realising Bhagvan's greatness in this way, he becomes free of worldly desires. Then, he feels, 'I never did have any desires. It was all like some kind of illusion. In reality, I have always been free of desires'. This is what a person experiences.
60.8 "This ekantik dharma can only be attained by following the agna of a sant who is free of worldly desires, and who has love for Bhagvan. It cannot be attained merely by reading shastras. Even if a person were to attempt to repeat those talks exactly, having merely heard them, he would not be able to do so properly. Therefore, a person can attain ekantik dharma only from someone who has already attained the state of ekantik dharma."

The Importance Of Upasana At The Time Of Death - Bhagvan Becomes Bound To His Bhakta
61.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fagan vad 3 [3rd March, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the platform under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He had tied a white cloth, with a border of silken thread, around His head. He was wearing a white khes, and had covered Himself with a white pachhedi. He was wearing garlands of white flowers around His neck, and tassels of white flowers were hanging from the left side of His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
61.2 Muktanand Swami then asked, "How can a person remain calm even under the influence of lust, anger, greed, and fear?"
61.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person who has firm atma- nishtha and believes 'I am not the body, but I am the atma, which is distinct from the body, and is the knower of all', never loses his calmness. On the other hand, a person without atma- nishtha may try many other means, but he cannot remain calm."
61.4 Brahmanand Swami then asked, "To what extent does atma- nishtha actually help a person at the time of death?"
61.5 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "When faced with the task of crossing a river, a person who knows how to swim, can easily cross it. On the other hand, a person who is unable to swim will be left standing. However, when faced with the task of crossing an ocean, both require the aid of a ship. Similarly, a river (cold and heat, hunger and thirst, honour and insult, happiness and misery) may be crossed by a person with atma-nishtha. However, death is like an ocean and both a person with atma-nishtha and a person without it, require the help of a ship ( nishchay) in Bhagvan. Therefore, only the firm refuge of Bhagvan is helpful at the time of death. atma- nishtha alone is of no use whatsoever at the time of death. For this reason, a person should firmly develop nishchay in Bhagvan."
61.6 Muktanand Swami then asked, "It is said that siddhis are shown to the bhaktas of Bhagvan. Does this fact apply only to those whose nishchay in Bhagvan is fickle, or also to those who have firm nishchay?"
61.7 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "Siddhis only appear before those whose nishchay in Bhagvan is continuous. For others, they are very difficult to attain. In fact, those siddhis are inspired by Bhagvan Himself to test His bhaktas – 'Does he have more love for me or for the siddhis?' Bhagvan tests His bhaktas in this way.
61.8 "If the bhakta happens to be completely devoted and desires nothing except Bhagvan, is free of worldly desires, and is an ekantik bhakta, then Bhagvan Himself becomes bound by that bhakta. For example, Vamanji seized Bali Raja's kingdom, which comprised of the Svarg-Lok, Mrutyu-Lok and Patal, and covered all fourteen loks with His first two steps. Bali Raja then offered his own body for Vamanji to place the third step. In this way, Bali Raja devoutly offered everything to Bhagvan. Also, despite the fact that Bhagvan deceived Bali Raja without any fault of his own, Bali still did not falter from His bhakti. On seeing such perfect bhakti for Him, Bhagvan ultimately became bound by Bali. Although Bhagvan bound Bali Raja only for a moment, in the process, Bhagvan himself became bound by ropes (Bali's unique bhakti). To this very day, Bhagvan is forever standing at Bali's gate, never out of Bali Raja's sight, not even for a fraction of a second.
61.9 "Likewise, after abandoning all other worldly desires and offering everything to Bhagvan, we should also remain as the das of Bhagvan. In the process, if Bhagvan happens to inflict more misery upon us, then Bhagvan Himself will become bound by us. This is because He loves His bhaktas, and is an ocean of kindness. He becomes bound by anyone who offers great bhakti to Him. As a result, the mind of a bhakta who has such loving bhakti, becomes so bound to Bhagvan, that Bhagvan is unable to free Himself from His bhakta.
61.10 "Therefore, we should become more pleased as Bhagvan puts us through more severe hardships, bearing in mind, 'The more misery Bhagvan inflicts upon me, the more bound He will become to me, so He will not be away from me for even a moment'. With such understanding, a person should become increasingly pleased as Bhagvan imposes more and more hardships. However, he should never become disheartened in the face of misery or for the sake of bodily comforts."

Acquiring The Qualities Of Bhagvan - Never Insult A Humble Bhakta
62.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fagan vad 4 [4th March, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in the middle of the courtyard of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. On His head, He was wearing a white pagh that was decorated with garlands and tassels of white flowers. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
62.2 Svayamprakashanand Swami then asked, "The Shreemad Bhagvat states: satyam shaucham daya kshanti-staya-gaha santosh arjavam shamo dama-stapaha samyam titikshop-ratiha shrutam gnanam virakti-raishvarya sauryam tejo balam smruti svatantryam kaushalam kanti-dhairya-mardav-meva cha pragala-bhyam prashnaya shilam shaha ojo balam bhagah gambhirya sthairya-mastikyam kirtimarno-naham-kruti" These thirty-nine kalyan-kari qualities forever dwell in the murti of Bhagvan. How can these qualities be acquired by a sadhu?"
62.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a sadhu develops the perfect nishchay in Bhagvan, then he will acquire these kalyan-kari qualities of Bhagvan. What is that nishchay? Well, he realises that Bhagvan is not like Kal, not like karma, not like svabhav, not like Maya, and not like Purush. He realises Bhagvan to be distinct from everything, their controller, and their cause. But despite being their cause, He is beyond their influence. A person, who has developed a nishchay in pratyaksha Bhagvan in this way, will never be deflected. Even if he hears misleading shastras, or if he hears the talks of misleading philosophers, or even if his own antah-karans raises doubts within himself, his nishchay in Bhagvan never weakens in any way.
62.4 "A person with such a nishchay in Bhagvan is said to have a relationship with Bhagvan. Moreover, he naturally acquires the qualities of whomever he has a relationship with. For example, when our eyes meet with an oil lamp, the light of that oil lamp enters our eyes, which expel the darkness around them. In the same way, a person who has developed a relationship with Bhagvan by having a firm nishchay in Him, acquires the kalyan-kari qualities of Bhagvan. As a result, just as Bhagvan is unattached in all respects and is capable of doing as He chooses, such a bhakta also becomes extremely capable and unattached."
62.5 Nirvikaranand Swami then asked, "Despite having the nishchay in Bhagvan, glorious qualities are still not acquired. Instead, man and irshya are increasing day by day. What can be the reason for this?"
62.6 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "Even if a person offers amrut, or shingadiyo vachhnag, or dudh-pak with sugar, or opium, in Bhagvan's thal, the natural qualities in each will still remain the same. They will not change in any way. Similarly, a person who is demonic and extremely undeserving, will still not abandon his own svabhav even if he comes into contact with Bhagvan. Furthermore, if he happens to insult some humble bhakta of Bhagvan, then the demonic person will suffer as a result. This is because Bhagvan is present in everyone as antaryami, and He displays His divine powers whenever and however He wishes. Therefore, insulting such a bhakta is equal to insulting Bhagvan. As a result, the offender suffers severely. For example, Hiranyakashipu was so powerful that he had conquered Svarg, Mrutyu-Lok, and Patal. However, as he harassed Prahladji, Bhagvan appeared from a pillar in the svarup of Nrusinh, and killed Hiranyakashipu.
62.7 "Bearing this in mind, a bhakta of Bhagvan should strive to develop humility and should never insult anyone, as Bhagvan also dwells in the hearts of those who are humble. Therefore, He will punish anyone who insults humble bhaktas. Realising this, a person should never hurt even the smallest of beings. However, if a person indiscriminately mistreats others out of abhiman, then Bhagvan, who is the destroyer of abhiman and who pervades all as antaryami, is unable to tolerate this. He will appear in one form or another to thoroughly destroy the abhiman of that person. Therefore, remaining fearful of Bhagvan, a sadhu should not retain even the slightest abhiman, nor should he hurt even the smallest of beings. This is the dharma of a nirmani sadhu."

Perfect Nishchay - The Greatness Of Bhagvan
63.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fagan vad 7 [7th March, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the platform outside the west-facing rooms in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a white cloth, with a border of silken thread, around His head. Garlands of white flowers adorned His neck, and tassels of roses had been inserted in His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
63.2 Nrusinhanand Swami then asked, "What kind of thoughts arise in a person who has a deficiency in his nishchay in Bhagvan?"
63.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person with a deficiency in nishchay would become extremely overjoyed on seeing Bhagvan displaying some of His powers. However, when he sees no such display of divine powers, he would become disheartened. Despite trying, if he is unable to eradicate impure thoughts from his heart, he then has a dislike towards Bhagvan. He would feel, 'I have bent over backwards practicing satsang for so long, yet Bhagvan still has not eradicated my impure thoughts'. In this way, he perceives an avgun in Bhagvan.
63.4 "Despite much effort, if he is unable to free his mind from the objects he cherishes, he then perceives that very same avgun in Bhagvan. Specifically, he believes, 'Just as I have vicious natures, such as kam and krodh, Bhagvan also has the same natures. The only difference is that Bhagvan is regarded as being great'. A person who has such doubtful thoughts within his heart, should be known to have a deficiency in nishchay; his nishchay cannot be called perfect."
63.5 Paramchaitanyanand Swami then asked, "Maharaj, what are the thoughts of a person with perfect nishchay in Bhagvan?"
63.6 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person with perfect nishchay feels within, 'I have attained all there is to attain. Wherever pratyaksha Bhagvan resides, that itself is the highest dham. All these sadhus are like Narad and the Sanakadik; all satsangis are like Uddhav, Akrur, Vidur, Sudama, and the cow-herds of Vrundavan, and female haribhaktas are like the Gopis, Draupadi, Kuntaji, Sita, Rukmani, Lakshmi, and Parvati. Now I have nothing more to achieve. I have attained Golok, Vaikunth, and Brahmpur'. A person with perfect nishchay has such thoughts and experiences extreme joy in his heart. A person who experiences such feelings should be known to have perfect nishchay."
63.7 Shreeji Maharaj continued, "A person who has perfectly understood the svarup of Bhagvan, has nothing left to realise. Please listen as I now explain the method of realising this. Hearing this, a person develops firm nishchay in Bhagvan.
63.8 "Firstly, he should realise the greatness of Bhagvan. To illustrate this, consider the analogy of a great king. If even his servants and maids stay in seven-storey mansions, and their gardens, horses, carriages, jewellery, and other luxuries make their houses appear as magnificent as Dev-Lok, then imagine how magnificent the darbar and its luxuries of that king must be. Similarly, consider the loks of the devs of this brahmand – Brahma and the other devs – who follow the agnas of Shree Purushottam Bhagvan. If there is no limit to those loks and their magnificence, then how can a person possibly comprehend the extent of the magnificence of Virat- Purush, from whose navel Brahma was produced? Furthermore, the master of countless millions of these Virat- Purush is Purushottam Bhagvan, whose dham is Akshar. Within that dham, countless millions of such brahmands float like mere atoms in each and every hair of Akshar. Such is the dham of Bhagvan. In that dham, Purushottam Bhagvan Himself resides eternally with a divya svarup. Moreover, countless divya objects exist in that dham. So, if this is the greatness of Akshar, then how can a person possibly comprehend the extent of Bhagvan's greatness? A person with nishchay understands Bhagvan's greatness in this way.
63.9 "Besides, that which is greater than another is more subtle than the other, and is also its cause. For example, jal is greater than pruthvi, is the cause of that pruthvi, and is more subtle than it as well. In turn, tej is greater than jal, vayu is greater than tej, and akash is greater than vayu. In the same way, Akshar, Prakruti- Purush, Pradhan- Purush, maha-tattva, and ahankar are all progressively greater than each other, the cause of each other and more subtle than each other. They also possess a svarup.
63.10 "In comparison, Bhagvan's Akshardham is extremely large. Countless millions of brahmand s float like mere atoms in each of its hairs. Just as an ant moving on the body of a huge elephant appears insignificant, everything else appears insignificant before the greatness of that Akshar. For example, an ant appears large amidst small mosquitoes; a scorpion appears large amidst ants; a snake appears large amidst scorpions; a kite appears large amidst snakes; a bull appears large amidst kites; an elephant appears large amidst bulls; a mountain such as Girnar appears large amidst elephants; and Mount Meru appears large amidst Girnar. In turn, Mount Loka-Lok appears extremely large amidst a mountain such as Meru. The pruthvi appears very large in comparison to Mount Loka-Lok. In turn, jal, the cause of pruthvi, is larger than it and is more subtle than it. In the same way, tej is the cause of jal, vayu is the cause of tej, akash is the cause of vayu, ahankar is the cause of akash, maha-tattva is the cause of ahankar, Pradhan- Purush are the cause of maha-tattva, and Mul- Prakruti and Brahm are the causes of Pradhan- Purush. The cause of all of these is Akshar- Brahm, which is the dham of Purushottam Bhagvan.
63.11 "That Akshar does not have any states of contraction or expansion; it forever remains in the same state. That Akshar also possesses a svarup, but because it is so vast, its svarup cannot be visualised. For example, the brahmand, which has evolved from the twenty-four tattvas, is known as Virat- Purush. That Virat- Purush possesses features like hands and feet, but because his murti is extremely vast, he is beyond visualisation. Brahma walked for a hundred of his own years (one year of Brahma is equivalent to 315,360,000 human years) on the stalk of the lotus that emerged from Virat- Purush's navel, but was still unable to reach its end. So, if the end of the lotus cannot be reached, how can Virat- Purush possibly be measured? Therefore, the svarup of Virat- Purush cannot be visualised. In the same way, despite having a definite svarup, Akshardham cannot be visualised. This is because countless brahmands float within its each and every hair.
63.12 "It is within that Akshardham, that Purushottam Bhagvan Himself resides eternally. By His antaryami powers, He resides in His anvay svarup in Akshardham, in the countless millions of brahmands, and also in the ishvars of those brahmands. Also in that Akshardham, countless millions of mukta s, who have acquired qualities similar to those of Bhagvan, remain in Bhagvan's seva. Also, divine light, equivalent to that of millions and millions of suns, radiates from each and every hair of those sevaks of Bhagvan. Therefore, if those sevaks are so great, how can the greatness of their master, Purushottam Bhagvan, possibly be described?
63.13 "That extremely powerful Bhagvan, enters Akshar and assumes the svarup of Akshar. He then assumes the svarup of Mul- Prakruti- Purush, and then the svarup of Pradhan- Purush. Then, He enters the twenty-four tattvas produced from Pradhan, and assumes that svarup. He then enters Virat- Purush produced from those tattvas, and assumes that svarup. He then enters Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiv, and assumes their svarups.
63.14 "In this way, that Bhagvan, who is extremely powerful, extremely luminous, and extremely great, contains His own spiritual powers and divine light with Himself and becomes like a human being for the kalyan of jeevs. He assumes a svarup that allows people to have His darshan, perform His seva, and offer worship to Him. For example, a tiny thorn that has pricked an ant's leg cannot be removed with a spear or a pin. It can only be removed using an extremely fine needle. In the same way, Bhagvan limits His own greatness within Himself, and assumes an extremely modest svarup. Just as Agni constrains his own light and flames to assume a human svarup, similarly, Bhagvan also suppresses His own powers and acts as a human for the kalyan of jeevs. However, a foolish person thinks, 'Why does Bhagvan not manifest any powers?' But, he does not realise that Bhagvan deliberately conceals His powers for the sake of the kalyan of jeevs. After all, if He were to manifest His own greatness, then even the brahmand would diminish into insignificance. Then, what can be said of jeevs?
63.15 "Kal, karma, and Maya are incapable of binding a person who has developed such firm nishchay, coupled with an understanding of Bhagvan's greatness, in his heart. Therefore, he who understands Bhagvan perfectly in this way, has nothing left to achieve."
63.16 Then, Nityanand Swami asked, "When Bhagvan assumes a human svarup, does He always do so sequentially in the order described, or can He also assume a human svarup directly?"
63.17 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "For Bhagvan, the sequential order is not necessary. For example, a person who takes a dives into a pond can emerge from wherever he wishes – either at the same entry point of the dive, or at the banks, or anywhere nearby. Similarly, if He so wishes, Purushottam Bhagvan can take a 'dive' in His Akshardham and directly assume a human svarup, or if He wishes, He can assume a human svarup following the sequential order."
63.18 Following this explanation, Shreeji Maharaj continued, "I shall now briefly explain the characteristics of a person with extremely firm nishchay, so please listen attentively. Firstly, a person with perfect nishchay will do anything asked of him on the path of pravrutti, without ever backing away, even if he has intense tyag. Moreover, he does not do it reluctantly; he does it willingly. The second characteristic is that regardless of any svabhav he may possess, even if it cannot be eradicated by a million ways, if he senses Bhagvan's insistence in abandoning that svabhav, he abandons it immediately. The third characteristic is that despite his own avgun, he is unable to live without the talks, kirtans, and the sant of Bhagvan, even for a moment. He finds avgun only within himself and thoroughly perceives the gun of a sant. He also understands the great glory of the talks and kirtans of Bhagvan, as well as of the sant of Bhagvan. A person with such understanding should be known to have perfect nishchay. Furthermore, if a person with this nishchay were to disobey the vartmans due to prarabdha, he would still not fall from the path of kalyan. In comparison, regardless of how great a tyagi a person may be, without this nishchay his kalyan is not guaranteed."

The Relationship Between Sharir And Shariri
64.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fagan vad 9 [9th March, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the platform outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with another black-bordered khes. He has also tied a white cloth with a border of silken thread around His head. Around His neck, He was wearing a new kanthi made from tulsi beads. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
64.2 Shreeji Maharaj then asked the munis, "The Shrutis mention that the atma and Akshar are the sharir of Purushottam, who is Bhagvan. That atma and Akshar are not subject to change, and are beyond the influences of maya. Moreover, like Bhagvan, the atma and Akshar are greater than Maya. Then, how can that atma and Akshar be described as the sharir of Bhagvan? This is because the sharir of a jeev is totally different from the jeev itself and is subject to change, whereas the jeev inside the body, is not subject to change. Therefore, just as the body of the jeev and the jeev itself are totally different, similarly, there should be the same degree of difference between Purushottam, and the atma and Akshar, which are the sharir of Purushottam. Please explain how they are different."
64.3 All the munis answered according to their understanding, but no one was able to provide a precise answer.
64.4 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Allow me to answer. The atma and Akshar make up the sharir of Purushottam Bhagvan, and they are pervaded, dependent, and powerless. In what way? Well, by means of His antaryami powers, Bhagvan pervades the atma and Akshar, whereas the atma and Akshar are the ones who are pervaded. Bhagvan is independent, whereas the atma and Akshar are dependent upon Bhagvan. Furthermore, Bhagvan is all-powerful, whereas the atma and Akshar are totally powerless before Him. In this way, Bhagvan is the shariri of both the atma and Akshar, and these two are the sharir of Bhagvan.
64.5 "That shariri, Purushottam Bhagvan, possesses an eternal divya murti. With His antaryami powers, Bhagvan resides as the atma of all the atmas. These atmas pervade their physical bodies, and are the drashta of these bodies. Bhagvan also resides in all the physical bodies, which are pervaded in relation to the atma s. These physical bodies are the drashya of atma. In this way, Purushottam Bhagvan is the atma of all. When referred to in the shastras as the atma of drashya, which has a svarup, Purushottam Bhagvan is also described to have a svarup. When referred to in the shastras as the atma of the drashta, He is described as nirakar. However, in reality Purushottam Bhagvan is different from both the drashya, which has a svarup, and the atma, which does not have a svarup. He eternally possesses a definite svarup, which is not an ordinary, worldly svarup. Moreover, despite possessing a definite svarup, He is the drashta of both the drashta and the drashya.
64.6 "Furthermore, Purushottam Bhagvan is the inspirer of both the atma and Akshar, is independent from them, and is their controller; He possesses all spiritual powers; He is greater than even Akshar, which is greater than everything. Out of compassion, that Purushottam Bhagvan appears as a human being on this earth, for the kalyan of jeevs. Understanding Him to eternally possess a divya svarup, a person who offers bhakti and upasana to Him acquires qualities similar to those of Bhagvan, as well as countless other spiritual powers.
64.7 "After such a person's atma has attained the state of brahm, he constantly remains in the seva of Purushottam Bhagvan with love and great devotion. On the other hand, a person who performs dhyan upon Bhagvan and offers upasana while believing Him to be nirakar, is merged into brahm-sushupti. He never returns from this state, nor does he ever acquire any spiritual powers from Bhagvan."
64.8 Finally, Shreeji Maharaj added, "I have delivered this talk having experienced it directly myself. Therefore, there is not a trace of doubt about it. Moreover, these facts can be understood only from a person who firmly believes that Bhagvan is forever divya and sakar. They can never be understood from others. Therefore, these facts should be thoroughly remembered by all."

Gnan-Shakti, Kriya-Shakti, And Ichha-Shakti
65.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fagan vad 14 [13th March, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow placed on the veranda outside His bedroom in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
65.2 While the katha was being read, Shreeji Maharaj called the senior paramhans near Him. When the katha was completed, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Now, all the senior sadhu s seated here will answer each other's questions. This will reveal their level of intelligence."
65.3 Svayamprakashanand Swami then asked Premanand Swami, "How is akash created, and how is it destroyed?"
65.4 Paramanand Swami attempted to answer the question, but was unable to provide a precise answer.
65.5 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "When a child is initially in its mother's womb and at the time of its birth, the cavities of its heart and other indriyas are small. But, as the child grows, those cavities develop; and the akash within increase as well. However, when the child becomes old, the cavities of its indriyas decrease in size, and the akash within also decrease. Similarly, when Virat's body is produced, akash appears to be created in the cavity of his heart and other internal organs. Also, when Virat's body is destroyed, the akash within appears to be destroyed as well. This is how akash is created and destroyed. However, just as Prakruti- Purush are eternal, the akash that is the supporter of all is also eternal. It is not subject to creation and destruction. However, akash is created and destroyed through samadhi. A person who experiences samadhi knows its method."
65.6 Paramanand Swami then asked Svayamprakashanand Swami, "How does the sushumna nadi reside within the body and outside of the body?"
65.7 Svayamprakashanand Swami attempted to answer the question, but could not do adequately.
65.8 Shreeji Maharaj then replied, "Whatever is present in this brahmand, is also present within this body. The only difference is that in the body the scale is small, whereas in the brahmand the scale is large. In fact, the arrangement of the brahmand is the same as that of the body. For example, just as there are rivers in the brahmand, similarly there are blood vessels in the body; just as there are oceans in the brahmand, similarly water is present in the abdomen of the body; and just as the sun and the moon are present in the brahmand, similarly the ida nadi and pingala nadi house the sun and moon in the body. In the same way, just as other objects are present in the brahmand, they are also present in the body.
65.9 "Also, the nadis of the indriyas in this body are coupled with those of the brahmand. When a person acquires control over the tongue, he attains Varun- Dev; when a person acquires control over speech, he attains Agni- Dev; when a person acquires control over the skin, he attains Vayu- Dev; when he acquires control over the genitals, he attains Prajapati; and when a person acquires control over the hands, he attains Indra. In the same way, when a person controls the brahm-randhra – the end portion of the sushumna nadi located in the heart – he reaches the arrogant dev by the name of Vaishvanar Agni, which resides in the shishumar chakra. It is then that he sees the uninterrupted path of light from the brahm-randhra to Prakruti- Purush. That path of light is known as sushumna. This is how the sushumna nadi resides in the body and in the brahmand."
65.10 Paramanand Swami asked Svayamprakashanand Swami another question, "Which state is destroyed first – the jagrat state, the svapna state, or the sushupti state?"
65.11 As Svayamprakashanand Swami was unable to answer that question, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "When a person focuses on the svarup of Bhagvan with love in the jagrat state, the jagrat state is destroyed first, then the svapna state, and finally the sushupti state. When the mind thinks of and focuses on the murti of Bhagvan in the svapna state, the svapna state is destroyed first, then the jagrat state, and finally the sushupti state. Furthermore, when a person attains the state of upsham, while concentrating on the svarup of Bhagvan, the sushupti state is destroyed first, then the jagrat state, and finally the svapna state." Shreeji Maharaj answered the question in this way.
65.12 Svayamprakashanand Swami then asked Paramanand Swami another question, "How should a person understand the 'ichha-shakti', 'gnan-shakti', and 'kriya-shakti' of Bhagvan?"
65.13 Laughing, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Even you probably do not know the answer to that question." He then began to give the answer Himself. " When sattva-gun is predominant, the rewards of any karmas performed by a jeev are experienced in the jagrat state. When rajo-gun is predominant, the rewards of any karmas performed are experienced in the svapna state. When tamo-gun is predominant, the rewards of any karmas performed are experienced in the sushupti state.
65.14 "When a jeev enters the state of jagrat, it becomes inert like a slab of stone, and retains no type of consciousness, such as, 'I am a pundit, or I am a fool; I have done this task, or I want to do this task; this is my gender, or this is my varna, or this is my ashram; this is my name, or my appearance is like this. Am I a dev, or am I a human? Am I a child, or am I old? Am I good, or am I a sinner?' and so on. No such consciousness is retained. When a jeev enters this state, Bhagvan awakens it from unconsciousness through His gnan- shakti and makes it aware of its actions. This is known as gnan- shakti, the power of understanding. Furthermore, whatever action a jeev engages in, it does so with the support of what is known as Bhagvan's kriya- shakti, the power of application. Finally, whatever object is desired by the jeev, is acquired with the help of what is known as Bhagvan's ichha- shakti, the power of free will.
65.15 "Moreover, the three states of jagrat, svapna, and sushupti experienced by a jeev are not due to the consequences of its own karma s alone. They are experienced only when Bhagvan, the giver of the rewards of karma s, allows the jeev to do so. When a jeev, indulging in the rewards of the jagrat state, wishes to enter the svapna state, it cannot do so independently. This is because Bhagvan, restrains its vrutti. Similarly, if it wishes to enter the jagrat state from the svapna, it is unable to do so; nor can it enter the sushupti state or emerge from it to enter the svapna or jagrat sates. It is only when Bhagvan allows it to indulge in the rewards of the karma s of the particular state that it is able to indulge in them. However, a jeev cannot indulge in the rewards of its karma s according to its own will or as a direct consequence of karma s. This is how a person should understand the gnan- shakti, kriya- shakti, and ichha- shakti of Bhagvan."
65.16 Shreeji Maharaj answered the question in this way, out of compassion.

Misinterpreting The Words Of The Shastras - The Four Avatars Of Bhagvan
66.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Fagan vad Amas [14th March, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a large decorated bedstead on the platform outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a khes with a black border, and had covered Himself with a white pachhedi. He had also tied a white feto around His head. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
66.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "The Shreemad Bhagvat describes Vasudev, Sankarshan, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha – four avatars of Bhagvan. In some places they are described as sagun, whereas in others places they are described as nirgun. The term nirgun is used in reference to Vasudev Bhagvan, and the term sagun is used in reference to Sankarshan, Aniruddha, and Pradyumna. However, when described as nirgun, the minds of the listener and the reader are confused, and they draw the conclusion that Bhagvan does not possess a svarup. However, this is their misunderstanding.
66.3 "Besides, the words of the shastras cannot be understood in their true context by anyone except an ekantik bhakta. These are words such as, ' Bhagvan is nirakar, luminous, nirgun, and all-pervading'. On hearing these descriptions, a fool concludes that the shastras describe Bhagvan as being nirakar. On the other hand, an ekantik bhakta realises, 'When the shastras describe Bhagvan as being nirakar and nirgun, they are referring to the fact that He does not possess a mayik svarup or mayik characteristics. In reality, His svarup is forever divya, and He possesses countless kalyan-kari qualities'.
66.4 "There is also a reference to Bhagvan being an immense mass of divine light. However, if there is no murti, then there can be no light either. Therefore, that light must definitely be from that murti. For example, take the murti of Agni. When flames radiate from his murti, only the flames – not the murti of Agni – are seen. However, a wise man realises that the flames are definitely radiating from Agni's murti. Similarly, water radiates from the murti of Varun. Although only the water – not the murti of Varun – is visible, a wise man realises that the water radiates from Varun's murti. In the same way, the divine light, which has the intensity of millions of suns and is like brahm-satta, is the light of the murti of Purushottam Bhagvan.
66.5 "The shastras also state, 'A thorn is used to remove a thorn, and then both are discarded. Similarly, Bhagvan assumes a physical body to relieve the earth of its burdens. Then, having relieved the earth of its burden, He discards the physical body'. Hearing such words, the foolish people are misled into the understanding that Bhagvan is nirakar, and they fail to realise the murti of Bhagvan as being divya.
66.6 "However, an ekantik bhakta has the following understanding: 'To fulfil Arjun's pledge, both Shree Krishna Bhagvan and Arjun left Dvarika on his chariot to fetch the Brahman's son. Crossing Mount Loka-Lok, they cut through Maya's veil of darkness with the Sudarshan Chakra. Driving the chariot through that darkness, they entered a mass of light. There, they collected the Brahman's son from Bhuma-Purush before returning. This was only because Shree Krishna Bhagvan's murti was divya. Due to the power of that divinity, the wooden chariot and the horses – despite being composed of the five bhuts – all became divya and beyond Maya, like chaitanya. Had their murtis not become divya, they would never have been able to rise above Maya. After all, everything that has evolved from Maya ultimately merges into Maya, and can never reach Brahm, which is beyond Maya'. Therefore, it was due to the powers of Bhagvan's murti that the mayik objects become non -mayik. A fool has the understanding that Bhagvan's murti is mayik, whereas an ekantik sadhu has the understanding that Bhagvan's murti is greater than Akshar. He also understands that Purushottam Bhagvan possesses a definite murti, and is the atma of countless millions of brahm-rup mukta s, and also of Akshardham.
66.7 "Therefore, regardless of which shastras are being read, if they describe Bhagvan as being nirgun, a person should realise that they are merely praising the glory of Bhagvan's murti. However, Bhagvan always possesses a definite murti. A person who realises this is known as an ekantik bhakta."

Acquiring The Qualities Of A Sat- Purush
67.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Chaitra sud 7 [21st March, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in the residential hall of the munis in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
67.2 Shreeji Maharaj then asked the munis, "There is a sat-purush who has no love at all for the pleasure of this world. He has desires only for the dham of Bhagvan and the svarup of Bhagvan. He also wishes the same for whoever associates with him. He feels, 'As this person has associated with me, it would be of great benefit to him if his desires for this world are eradicated, and his love for Bhagvan is developed'. Furthermore, all the efforts that are made by the sat- purush, are only for acquiring bliss after attaining the dham of Bhagvan after death. He never does anything for the sake of bodily comforts. So, with what understanding can a mumukshu acquire the qualities of such a sat- purush, and what understanding causes such qualities to not be acquired? That is the question?"
67.3 Muktanand Swami replied, "If a person views such a sat- purush, who has no desire for the pleasures of this world, and accepts whatever words are uttered by him, then that mumukshu will acquire the qualities of that sat- purush. A person who does not do so will not acquire those qualities."
67.4 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "That answer is correct, but please listen as I explain the method of understanding by which a mumukshu can acquire the qualities of the great sat- purush. A person perceives the qualities of such a sat- purush, who has no love for anything except Bhagvan, by believing, 'This sant is extremely great. Despite thousands of people standing before Him with folded hands, he does not have the slightest desire for the pleasures of the world. As for me, I am extremely insignificant, and I am solely attached to worldly pleasures. I do not understand anything at all about Bhagvan. Shame on me'. In this way, he feels guilt and perceives the gun of the great sant. He also feels guilt after realising his own avgun. While repeating in this way, vairagya arises in his heart, and then, he acquires qualities similar to those of that sat-purush.
67.5 "Now, please listen as I describe the characteristics of a person in whose heart the qualities of the sat- purush are never acquired. Such a person believes, 'The sat-purush is said to be great, yet he has no kind of common sense whatsoever. He does not even know how to eat and drink properly, nor does he know how to dress properly. Bhagvan has given him abundant pleasures, yet he does not know how to enjoy them. Moreover, when he gives anything to anyone, he does so at random'. In this way, he perceives countless types of avgun in the sat-purush. Such a cruel person never acquires the qualities of a sat-purush."

Bhagvan Resides In The Eight Types Of Murtis And In A Sant
68.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Chaitra sud 9 [23rd March, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. Around His head, He had tied a white cloth with border of silken thread. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places had gathered before Him.
68.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Allow me to ask a question."
68.3 The munis responded by saying, "Please do ask."
68.4 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "For one month during the famine of Samvat 1869, whenever I entered samadhi, I felt I had gone to Purushottam- Puri, where I entered and resided in the murti of Shree Jagan- Nathji. That murti may appear to be wooden, but through its eyes I observed everything. I observed both the bhakti and the deceitful ways of the mandir's pujari. In the same way, those people in our satsang who have mastered samadhi can also enter the bodies of others through samadhi, and see and hear everything. The shastras also mention that Shukji spoke through the body of a tree. Therefore, a great sat- purush or Bhagvan can enter wherever they wish.
68.5 "Bhagvan has given eight types of murti s for worship by His agna – shaili (stone), darumayi (wood), lauhi (metal), lepya (earth or sandalwood paste), lekhya (engraved or drawn), saikati (sand), manimayi (gems), and manomayi (mental). Bhagvan Himself personally enters those murti s and resides within them. A bhakta of Bhagvan, who worships those murti s, should maintain the same respect for them as he does for pratyaksha Bhagvan.
68.6 "In the same way, Bhagvan also resides in the heart of a sant. Therefore, a sant should also be respected. In spite of that, a bhakta totally fails to respect him. He considers a murti to be merely a painting or to be made of stone or other materials. Furthermore, he looks upon that sant as an ordinary human being. But Bhagvan Himself has said, 'I forever reside in the eight types of murtis and in a sant'. Still, that bhakta behaves disrespectfully before the murti s of Bhagvan and before a sant, not at all fearing Bhagvan. Does such a person have nishchay in Bhagvan, or not? That is the question."
68.7 The paramhans replied, "As he does not realise Bhagvan to be antaryami and fails to respect Him, such a bhakta does not have nishchay in Bhagvan at all. He does not have nishchay, so his bhakti is like that of a hypocrite."
68.8 Shreeji Maharaj then asked further, "Will such a bhakta attain kalyan, or not?"
68.9 The sadhu s replied, "No, he will not attain kalyan."
68.10 Shreeji Maharaj then continued, "A person who develops such a nastik attitude towards the murtis of Bhagvan and a sant, will not stop there. He will also develop nastik feelings towards the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan whom he worships. He will also develop nastik feelings towards the dhams of Bhagvan, such as Golok and Brahmpur. Furthermore, he will come to believe that the creation, sustenance, and destruction of this universe are due to Kal, Maya, and karma, but not due to the will of Bhagvan. In this way, he will become a firm nastik."
68.11 Muktanand Swami then asked, "Is this nastik attitude due to a person's past karma s, or due to the influence of kusang?"
68.12 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The sole cause of the development of such a nastik attitude is listening to the shastras of nastiks and keeping the company of a person who has faith in those shastras. Furthermore, kam, krodh, lobh, ahankar, man, and irshya also cause a nastik attitude to develop. A person who possesses any one of these svabhav s, will not be able to believe the talks of even sadhu s, such as Narad and the Sanakadik.
68.13 "When is such a nastik attitude overcome? Well, when a person listens to talks of the leelas of Bhagvan, such as the creation, sustenance, and destruction of the universe as described in astik shastras, like the Shreemad Bhagvat, and also understands the greatness of Bhagvan and a sant, the nastik attitude is overcome and an astik attitude develops."

Non-Violence - Never Think Cruelly Of Others - Do Not Associate With A Nastik
69.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Chaitra sud 12 [26th March, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms in front on the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
69.2 Following the sandhya arti of Shree Vasudev-Narayan and the ' Narayan' dhun, Shreeji Maharaj asked the munis, "What exactly is dharma? Please base your reply on the shastras. The question arises because even the kings of the past who indulged in violence, did not harm those who took their refuge, nor did they allow harm to others. So, is the sin committed by killing others, considered the same as the sin of killing a person who has sought his refuge?"
69.3 The munis attempted to reply according to their own understanding, but due to queries raised by Shreeji Maharaj, no one was able to offer a satisfactory answer. All the munis then said, "Maharaj, we would like to put the same question to you. Violence ( hinsa) performed on animals, as part of a sacrifice or some other ritual, is considered to be dharma. But, non-violence ( ahinsa) is also considered to be dharma. Please clarify this."
69.4 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "Dharma involving violence is for the attainment of dharma, arth, and kam. Moreover, the dharma which permits violence is for the purpose of limiting violence. Non-violence, on the other hand, is for the attainment of kalyan – which is the dharma of a sadhu. Dharma involving violence is for fulfilling worldly desires, but it is not for the attainment of kalyan, whereas non-violence is solely for the purpose of attaining kalyan.
69.5 "Therefore, for both grahasthas and tyagis only non-violence has been cited for the attainment of kalyan. For example, Uparichar-Vasu Raja ruled over a kingdom and still followed a non-violent lifestyle. Therefore, a sadhu should not bear hatred towards anyone by thought, word, or deed. Neither should he keep any form of aggression. Instead, he should behave as a das of a das with all.
69.6 "In comparison, having an aggressive personality is the dharma of a wicked person, and behaving in a calm manner is the dharma of a sadhu. Someone may then ask, 'How is it possible to maintain the characteristics of a sadhu, while trying to make thousands of people follow their niyams?' Well, the reply to the question is that Yudhishthir Raja reigned over a kingdom stretching for thousands of miles, yet he managed to maintain the qualities of a sadhu. Conversely, there may be thousands like Bhimsen who intimidate others and are unable to change their ways despite being lectured. In fact, there is no shortage of people with such an aggressive nature; there are countless such people. However, to be a sadhu, is indeed very difficult."

Saved From Death By The Prick Of A Thorn
70.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Chaitra sud 15 [29th March, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He had tied a white cloth with a border of silken thread around His head. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. With His hand, He was turning a mala of tulsi beads. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
70.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Senior paramhans, please ask questions amongst yourselves. If a grahastha has a question, he may ask the paramhans."
70.3 Kaka-Bhai, a bhakta from the village of Rojka, then asked Nityanand Swami, "Deep within a person's heart, something signals him to indulge in the vishays, while something else says 'no' and discourages him from indulging in them. What is it that says 'no', and what is it that says 'yes'?"
70.4 Nityanand Swami replied, "It is the jeev that says 'no', and it is the mind that says 'yes'."
70.5 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Allow me to answer that question. From the very day we began to understand and realise who our parents were, they taught us: 'This is your mother and this is your father; this is your kaka and this is your brother; this is your mama and this is your sister; this is your mami and this is your kaki; this is your masi and this is your buffalo; this is your cow and this is your horse; these are your clothes and this is your house; this is your mansion, this is your farm, and this is your jewellery'. These words of kusangis have been imprinted in the mind. How are they imprinted? Well, it is like the small pieces of glass that women attach into works of embroidery, where the mind represents the embroidery, and the jeev represents the piece of glass. In this way, the words and the sights of those kusangis, along with the other types of vishays, have become imprinted in the mind.
70.6 "Then, after the person enters satsang, the sant talks about the glory of Bhagvan, how to reject the vishays, and also explains that the world is perishable. In this way, the words and the sight of the sant dwell in the person's mind.
70.7 "Take the example of two armies facing each other. In the battlefield of Kurukshetra, the armies of the Kauravs and the Pandavs stood facing each other and fought with arrows, spears, and various other types of weapons. Some fought with swords, some fought with maces, and some fought with their bare hands. In the process, some lost their heads, others injured their thighs, and many were slaughtered. Similarly, in the person's antah-karans, there are forms of the kusangis standing armed with their weapons (five vishays). Opposite them, are also forms of the sant standing armed with weapons in the form of words such as, 'Bhagvan is satya, the world is perishable, and the vishays are false'. Therefore, a mutual conflict exists between these two sets of words. When the force of the kusangis prevails, a desire to indulge in the vishays arises. When the force of the sant prevails, the desire to indulge in the vishays disappears. In this way, there is a conflict within the antah-karans. There is a shlok: yatra yogesh-varaha krushno yatra partho dhanur-dharaha tatra shreer-vijayo bhootir-dhruva neetir-matir-mama" The meaning of this shlok is: Only where there is Yogeshvar, Shree Krishna Bhagvan, and where there is the great archer Arjun, there is Lakshmi, victory, divine powers, and resolute morality exist'. Therefore, a person should have the firm belief that victory belongs to the person on whose side these sadhu s happen to be."
70.8 Kaka-Bhai then asked further, "Maharaj, by what means can the force of a sant increase and the force of the kusangis decrease?"
70.9 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The kusangis that reside internally and externally, are both one. Also, the sant residing within and the sant residing externally, are both one. The force of the internal kusangis increases with the encouragement of the external kusangis. In the same way, the force of the sant within increases with the encouragement of the sant residing externally. Therefore, by avoiding the company of external kusangis, and by keeping the company of only the sant residing externally, the force of the kusangis decreases and the force of the sant increases." That is how Shreeji Maharaj answered that question.
70.10 Again, Kaka-Bhai asked, "Maharaj, there is a person who has overcome the fight against kusangis, and for whom only the force of the sant is the strongest. There is another person whose conflict is still on-going. Of the two, when the first person dies, there is no doubt that he will attain the dham of Bhagvan. But, please tell us what will be the fate of the second person, whose conflict is still on-going, when he dies?"
70.11 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "In a battle, one person may face Vaniyas or someone from a weak social-caste. As a result, he may easily win. Another person is confronted by an army of Arabs, Rajputs, Kathis, and Kolis, who are very difficult to conquer, and are certainly not as easy to defeat as the Vaniyas. Therefore, his fight continues. In the process of such fighting, if he wins, then all is well and good. But, if while fighting he does not give in to his opponents, despite their attempts, and if he were to die at that time, would his master not be aware of his courageous efforts? Would He not appreciate that, compared to the person who faced the easy opposition of the Vaniyas, this person faced frightening opposition that was difficult to overcome? The master would indeed be well aware of both situations. In the same way, Bhagvan is sure to help such a person as you have described. He will believe, 'This person is faced with the overwhelming force of fluctuating thoughts, yet he is still putting up a brave fight. Therefore, he deserves to be congratulated'. Realising this, Bhagvan does help him. For this reason, a person should remain carefree and not worry in the least. He should continue to worship Bhagvan in the same way, keep the sant the most important, and stay away from kusangis." Shreeji Maharaj replied joyfully in this way.
70.12 Jeeva-Bhai, from the village Jaska, then asked Nityanand Swami, "How can we develop unfaltering nishchay in Bhagvan?"
70.13 Nityanand Swami replied, "If a person avoids the company of kusangis and constantly keeps the company of sadhu s, then listening to the talks of those sadhu s will lead to the development of unfaltering nishchay in Bhagvan. However, if he keeps the company of kusangis, unfaltering nishchay will not develop."
70.14 Again Shreeji Maharaj said, "Allow me to answer that question. A person should develop nishchay in Bhagvan for the sole purpose of the kalyan of his jeev, but not out of a desire for some material object. For example, 'If I practice satsang, my ill body will recover', or 'If I am childless, I will have a son', or 'If my sons are dying, they will live', or 'If I am poor, I will become rich', or 'If I practice satsang, I will regain my lost land'. A person should not practice satsang while keeping desires for material possessions. If a person does practice satsang with such desires, then he may become a very loyal satsangi if those desires are fulfilled. However, if his desires are not fulfilled, his nishchay will diminish. Therefore, a person should practice satsang solely for the kalyan of his jeev, and should not have any desire whatsoever for any material objects.
70.15 "Also, if there are ten members in a household and all ten are faced with death, then is it a small feat if even one is saved? Or if a person was destined to have to beg for food but received a rotlo to eat instead, is that a small feat? In these cases, a person should believe that although everything was going to be lost, at least this much has been saved! In the same way, even if extreme misery is due to occur, that misery would certainly decrease slightly if a person were to keep the refuge of Bhagvan. However, the jeev fails to understand this. Also, the refuge of Bhagvan can save a person who is meant to be executed on a shuli with suffering a mere pinprick.
70.16 "There is a story that illustrates this: Many thieves lived in a village. One of the thieves often kept the company of a sadhu. Then one day, while the thief was on his way to visit the sadhu, a thorn pierced his foot. As a result, his foot became swollen and he was unable to accompany the other thieves in a robbery. The other thieves, who went to steal, broke into a king's treasury and escaped with a great large amount of money, which they shared among themselves. Naturally, a lot of money came their way. On hearing this news, the parents, wife, and relatives of the thief who used to sit with the sadhu and who was injured, scolded him: 'Because you went to the sadhu instead of going to steal, we lost out. The thieves who did go to steal returned with lots of money'. Meanwhile, the king's army arrived, arrested all the thieves, and took them away to be executed on a shuli. The injured thief was also caught and sentenced to execution. However, all the villagers and the sadhu stood witness and said, 'This man was not involved in the theft as he had been hurt by a thorn'. The thief was then released.
70.17 "In the same way, if a person who practices satsang were to face the suffering of being executed on a shuli, it would be reduced to the pain of a mere thorn-pick. After all, I have asked Ramanand Swami, 'If your satsangi is destined to suffer the distress inflicted by the sting of one scorpion, may the distress of the stings of millions and millions of scorpions occur at each and every pore of my body, but no pain should distress your satsangi. Also, if the begging bowl is written in the prarabdha of your satsangi, may that begging bowl come to me, but on no account should your satsangi suffer from the lack of food or clothing. Please grant me these two vardans'. I asked this of Ramanand Swami, and he happily granted it to me. Therefore, destined worldly miseries, do not fall upon a person practicing satsang.
70.18 "So, if a person practices satsang with desires for temporary material objects, then doubts will certainly cloud his nishchay. Therefore, other than the desire for the kalyan of his own jeev, a person should practice satsang having no desire whatsoever. Only then will unfaltering nishchay develop."

Bhagvan Incarnates With His Akshardham
71.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the evening of Chaitra vad 4 [2nd April, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting with a large, cylindrical pillow on a decorated bedstead which had been placed on the platform in front of the west-facing medi in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a white feto around His head. A sabha of sadhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Muktanand Swami and some sadhus were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of musical instruments.
71.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please conclude the kirtans for now, and begin a question-answer discussion amongst yourselves."
71.3 Somla Khachar then asked, "Bhagvan forgives all the mistakes of His bhaktas, but which one mistake does He not forgive?"
71.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Bhagvan forgives all other mistakes, but He does not forgive the mistake of insulting a bhakta of Bhagvan. Therefore, a person should never harm a bhakta of Bhagvan in any way whatsoever. Furthermore, of all the mistakes made against Bhagvan, to deny the svarup of Bhagvan is a very serious mistake. A person should never make this mistake; and anyone who does make this mistake, commits a sin more serious than the five great sins.
71.5 "Denying the svarup of Bhagvan is nothing more than understanding Bhagvan, who eternally is sakar, to be nirakar. In fact, Bhagvan who is Purushottam, forever resides with a divya svarup in His Akshardham, and His divine light is like that of millions of suns and moons. Countless millions of brahm-rup mukta s serve the holy feet of that Bhagvan. That Bhagvan, also known as Parbrahm Purushottam, incarnates on earth out of compassion, for the kalyan of the jeevs. When He incarnates, all tattvas that He accepts become brahm. The three bodies ( sthul, sukshma, and karan), the three mental states ( jagrat, svapna, and sushupti), the ten indriyas, and the five prans, were all apparent in avatars such as Ram and Krishna. Although all of them appear to be like ordinary humans, in reality they are all brahm, not mayik. Therefore, a person should never deny the svarup of Bhagvan."
71.6 Matra Dhadhal then asked, "What is the characteristic of jealousy?"
71.7 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person who is jealous of someone cannot tolerate that person benefiting in any way. He would be pleased if misery falls upon that person. That is the characteristic of jealousy."
71.8 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked the munis, "A person who has nishchay in the pratyaksha murti of Bhagvan, worships Bhagvan, and behaves in accordance with the niyams of satsang, will attain kalyan. That is the way of satsang. However, what are the methods of kalyan according to the shastras? The meanings of the Veds are indeed very difficult to understand, so they are not narrated in kathas. However, the Shreemad Bhagvat Puran and the Mahabharat contain the message of the Veds, and are easier to understand. Therefore, they are widely narrated in public katha. Please explain how a person can attain kalyan as explained in the shastras. Also, bear in mind that Shankar - acharya has proposed that Bhagvan is nirakar, whereas Ramanuj-acharya and other acharyas have proposed that Bhagvan is sakar. Therefore, please base your answer on the principles of the shastras."
71.9 Using references from shastras, the munis then disproved the view that Bhagvan is nirakar, and promoted the view that kalyan is only possible by the worship of Bhagvan with a sakar murti.
71.10 Shreeji Maharaj then commented, "I myself also accept that view, but I would like to ask you a question regarding this. Purushottam Bhagvan is greater than the nirakar Akshar- Brahm and He is eternally s akar. If a person, who has found that Bhagvan on this earth, still cherishes a desire to see Brahmpur, Golok, Vaikunth, Shvet-Dvip, and the other dhams of Bhagvan, can he be said to have nishchay in Bhagvan, or not?"
71.11 The munis replied, "Despite having found Bhagvan, a person who constantly feels in his mind, 'Only when I see Akshardham and other dhams, or see the light of millions and millions of suns, is my kalyan attained,' does not have absolute nishchay."
71.12 Shreeji Maharaj argued this by asking, "What sin has he committed in having a desire to see Brahmpur, the other dhams and the svarup of brahm, that you disqualify his nishchay?"
71.13 The munis replied, "Why should a person who believes that kalyan is attained by the mere darshan of pratyaksha Bhagvan have a dislike for Brahmpur, Golok, and other dhams? After all, they do belong to Bhagvan. Also, without Bhagvan, he would have no desire for them."
71.14 Shreeji Maharaj further questioned, "Those dhams and the parshads residing in them, are chaitanya and are beyond Maya. So, what flaw is there in them that a person should not desire to see them? Also, what about Bhagvan who is pratyaksha on this earth? How do you view His parshads, who are in fact perishable, and the houses He lives in, which can be destroyed?"
71.15 The munis replied, "We understand those houses to be like Brahmpur and the other dhams, and we understand those parshads to be brahm-rup."
71.16 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Brahmpur and the parshads of Bhagvan residing in Brahmpur are immortal and imperishable, whereas the houses and parshads of this Mrutyu-Lok are perishable. How can you possibly compare the two?"
71.17 Finally, Nityanand Swami requested, "Maharaj, you will have to answer that question."
71.18 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "When Bhagvan incarnates for the purpose of granting kalyan to the jeevs, He is always accompanied by His Akshardham, His parshads – who are chaitanya – and all of His divine powers. However, they are not perceived by others. Nevertheless, when a bhakta acquires an alokik vision during samadhi, he does see divine light equivalent to countless millions of suns in the murti of Bhagvan. Together with the murti, he also sees countless millions of mukta s, and also Akshardham itself. Therefore, all of these do accompany Bhagvan. Despite all of this, Bhagvan only accepts the seva of His own, earthly bhaktas. He stays in the houses of His bhaktas, which are made of mud, clay, and stone. He lovingly accepts whatever those bhaktas offer Him, whether it is incense, an oil lamp, food, clothes, or anything else. He does so for the purpose of elevating those earthly parshads to the ranks of divya parshads. All the objects that a bhakta offers to Bhagvan assume a divya form in the dham of Bhagvan. Moreover, that bhakta also attains a divya svarup and attains those divya objects there. In this way, Bhagvan accepts all the offerings offered by His earthly bhaktas in order to allow them to experience everlasting bliss. Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvan should realise that the svarup of Bhagvan, along with His Akshardham, is present on this earth, and he should also explain this fact to others."

Gadhada I – 72
Nishchay Coupled With The Knowledge Of Bhagvan's Greatness
72.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Chaitra vad 11 [9th April, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting facing east on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms near the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
72.2 Then, Muktanand Swami said, "Maharaj, yesterday you had a very nice talk with Dada Khachar. All of us very much wish to hear that talk."
72.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a bhakta of Bhagvan has nishchay in Bhagvan coupled with the knowledge of His greatness, and also thoroughly realises the greatness of the sadhu s and satsangis, then even if that bhakta's karma s and kal happen to be unpleasant, both kal and karma combined are incapable of harming him due to the extreme force of his bhakti. On the other hand, a person lacking nishchay in Bhagvan and His sant, does not benefit in any way, even if Bhagvan wishes to do good for that person.
72.4 "A person who suppresses the humble, does not benefit in any way either. In fact, Bhishma-Pita has said to Yudhishthir Raja in the Mahabharat, 'If you suppress the humble, you and your descendants will be burnt to ashes'. Therefore, whether he is a bhakta of Bhagvan or not, no humble person should even slightly be pained. Moreover, if a person does hurt the humble, not only does he not benefit in any way, but he also incurs a sin equivalent to the sin of killing a brahman.
72.5 "In the same way, the sin incurred by making false allegations against someone is also equivalent to killing a brahman. Even if the allegations happen to be true, a person should constructively advise the person in private, but in no way should he be publicly humiliated.
72.6 "Similarly, a person who forces the five categories of women to lapse in their dharma, also incurs the sin of killing a brahman. What are these five categories of women? First, a woman who has sought a person's refuge; second, a person's own wife who does not desire intimacy on days of vrat or on day of fasting; third, a woman who is a pati-vrata wife; fourth, a widow; and fifth, a women who has placed her trust in a person. If a person commits adultery with these five categories of women, he incurs the sin of killing a brahman. Of these five categories, if a widow's mind wavers towards immorality, she should be inspired to follow dharma."
72.7 The munis began to sing rasik kirtans of Bhagvan. Hearing them, Shreeji Maharaj said, "When Bhagvan assumes a body for the sake of the kalyan of the jeevs, all of His actions are like those of humans. On seeing those actions, a bhakta of Bhagvan understands them to be charitras, whereas a vimukh or a weak-minded bhakta perceives avgun. For example, when Shukji narrated the ras- leela, Parikshit Raja had a doubt, and so asked, 'Bhagvan had incarnated to establish the order of dharma. Then, why did he commit a breach of dharma by associating with the wives of others? ' In this way, Parikshit perceived avgun in Bhagvan.
72.8 Shukji, on the other hand, thoughtfully began singing praises of Bhagvan, explaining that Kam-Dev has conquered Brahma and other devs and brought them under his control. This has greatly inflated Kam-Dev's arrogance. To vanquish that arrogance, Bhagvan challenged Kam-Dev. Just as a powerful king gives his own weapons to his enemy prior to fighting him, Bhagvan also gave his enemy ( Kam-Dev), the necessary 'ammunition' for fighting. What was that 'ammunition'? Well, the force of Kam- D ev is revealed in the company of women, and that force is also greater during the nights of the monsoon season. In addition, romantic gestures of women, listening to seductive words, seeing the beauty of women, and touching women, greatly increase the force of Kam-Dev. After giving all of this as 'ammunition' to Kam-Dev, Shree Krishna Bhagvan conquered Kam-Dev and continuously remained an urdhva-reta like a brahm-chari. In this way, he vanquished Kam-Dev's arrogance. No one except Bhagvan possesses such magnificent powers. It was after realising this immense power of Bhagvan that Shukji celebrated the charitras of Bhagvan. However, as Parikshit Raja failed to understand this, he perceived an avgun in Bhagvan.
72.9 "However, someone may ask you, 'Being paramhans, why do you sing such rasik kirtans?' In that case, you should tell that person, 'If we do not sing rasik kirtans, and instead perceive avgun in the rasik charitras of Bhagvan, then we would also join the ranks of Parikshit Raja and other nastik vimukhs. However, we do not wish to join the ranks of vimukhs. After all, Shukji , who is considered to be the guru of all paramhans, himself celebrated the rasik charitras of Bhagvan. Therefore, we must also certainly do the same'.
72.10 "Nevertheless, when Purushottam Bhagvan, who is greater than both the perishable and the imperishable, assumes a human svarup and travels in the brahmand for the kalyan of the jeevs, His charitras are just like those of all humans. Just as humans possess mayik svabhav s such as kam, krodh, lobh, moh, mad, matsar, irshya, asha, trushna, abhiman, defeat, victory, fear, and grief, Bhagvan also exhibits the same svabhav s Himself. However, they are all for the kalyan of the jeevs. So, a true bhakta celebrates the charitras of Bhagvan and attains Akshardham, whereas a vimukh perceives avgun in them.
72.11 "In fact, just as Bhagvan is the atma of the perishable, He is also the atma of Akshar- Brahm, who is greater than Prakruti and Purush. With His own powers, Bhagvan supports both the perishable and the imperishable, yet He Himself is distinct from them both. Furthermore, the greatness of Bhagvan is such that within the pore of His each and every hair, countless millions of brahmands appear as mere atoms. Only when that great Bhagvan becomes like a human for the sake of the kalyan of the jeevs, do they have an opportunity to do His seva. If He were to remain exactly the same size as He really is, then even the ruling devs of this brahmand, like Brahma, would be incapable of having His darshan and performing His seva. Then, what can be said of mere humans?
72.12 "Consider the vadvanal fire that dwells in the ocean. Despite consuming the waters of the ocean, it is so vast that even the water of the ocean cannot extinguish it. If we wished to light an oil lamp in our homes and that vadvanal fire were to enter our homes, instead of enjoying the light of the oil lamp, we would all be burnt and reduced to ashes. However, if that same fire were to assume the form of an oil lamp, its light would provide joy, even though the oil lamp is the very same fire. The oil lamp is so weak that it could be easily extinguished by blowing on it or smothering it by hand. Nevertheless, only it can provide comfort to us, whereas the vadvanal fire cannot.
72.13 "In the same way, Bhagvan may appear to be as powerless as a human, but only through that svarup can countless jeevs attain kalyan. The jeevs are incapable of even doing darshan of His murti, within who's each and every hair reside countless millions of brahmands. This makes kalyan impossible through that murti. Therefore, all charitras Bhagvan performs after assuming a human murti are worthy of being celebrated. A person should not doubt, 'Despite being Bhagvan, why does He do this?' In fact, to realise all of Bhagvan's charitras as kalyan-kari, is the very dharma of a bhakta. Only a person who understands this can be called a perfect bhakta of Bhagvan."
72.14 Kaka-Bhai, of the village Rojka, then asked, "What are the characteristics of a person who merely has nishchay in Bhagvan, without realising His greatness? Also, what are the characteristics of person who has nishchay in Bhagvan coupled with the knowledge of His greatness?"
72.15 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person with only nishchay still has the doubt, 'Although I have attained Bhagvan, will I attain kalyan or not?' On the other hand, a person with nishchay coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness believes, 'From the very day I had the darshan of Bhagvan, my kalyan has been guaranteed. In fact, kalyan is also assured to anyone who devoutly has my darshan or accepts my advice. Then, how can there be any doubt regarding my own kalyan? I am indeed absolutely fulfilled. Furthermore, whichever spiritual activity I do perform, I perform solely to please Bhagvan'. A person with such understanding should be known to have nishchay in Bhagvan coupled with the knowledge of His greatness."
72.16 Again, Kaka-Bhai asked, "What are the characteristics of the three types of bhaktas of Bhagvan – uttam, madhyam, and kanishth?"
72.17 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The uttam bhakta believes himself to be the atma, and distinct from his body. He does not associate the qualities of the body ( jad, full of misery, perishable, impure) with the atma, and nor does he associate the qualities of the atma ( achhedhya, abhedhya, avinashi) with the body. He sees the jeevatma residing in his body, as well as the Paramatma dwelling within his atma. Not only that, he sees the atmas residing in the bodies of the others as well. Despite having become so skilled, he realises Bhagvan and His sant to be superior to atma- nishtha, and does not have even the slightest pride in the fact that he has attained atma- nishtha. A person with such characteristics is said to be an uttam bhakta.
72.18 "In comparison, a person who becomes jealous of bhaktas of Bhagvan, despite having knowledge of the atma and nishchay in Bhagvan, should be considered to be madhyam bhakta. If Bhagvan were to insult this person, he develops jealousy towards Bhagvan, and feels, 'Even though Bhagvan is so great, why is He treating me this way, despite no fault of my own?'
72.19 "Finally, a person who has nishchay in Bhagvan but no atma- nishtha, has love for Bhagvan as well as for the affairs of this world, and experiences joy and grief in the affairs of this world, should be considered to be a kanishth bhakta."

Gadhada I – 73
Conquering Lust - The World's Greatest Brahm-Chari
73.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the night of Chaitra vad Amas [12th April, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the north-facing room of His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a white feto around His head. At that time, four senior sadhu s, including Muktanand Swami, and some fifty other haribhaktas, had gathered before Him.
73.2 Then, Gopalanand Swami asked, "What is the nature of lust?"
73.3 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "Semen alone is the nature of lust."
73.4 Gopalanand Swami then raised a doubt, "Semen is one of the seven basic constituents of the body – the seven basic constituents of the body are: ras (bodily fluids), rakta (blood), mans (muscle), med (fat), asthi (bones), majja (marrow), and shukra (semen). Then, how can semen alone be called the nature of lust? Also, how exactly is that semen produced?"
73.5 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The mind resides in the mano-vaha nadi. Whenever a thought related to women arises in the mind, semen is churned from the body, and after collecting in the mano-vaha nadi, it is discharged through the genitals – just as ghee surfaces from yoghurt when it is churned by a churning rod. A person whose semen is not discharged through the genitals is known as an urdhva- reta and a perfect brahm- c hari. When Shree Krishna Bhagvan associated with the gopis during the ras-leela, he did not allow the discharge of semen. For this reason, he was known as an urdhva-reta brahm-c hari, and had therefore conquered lust. Therefore, semen alone is the nature of lust. A person who has conquered semen, has conquered lust."
73.6 Gopalanand Swami asked again, "When the body is burnt after death, its seven constituents are burnt along with it. Therefore, if semen alone is the nature of lust, then by the burning of semen along with the body, lust should also be burnt. Why then, does lust arise when the jeev enters another body?"
73.7 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Semen is retained in the sukshma body. Moreover, it is because of the sukshma body that the sthul body is produced. When a ghost, which is mainly composed of a sukshma body, enters into the sthul body of another man and associates with a woman, that woman conceives a child by that ghost. Therefore, semen is definitely retained in the sukshma body."
73.8 Gopalanand Swami questioned further, "Shivji was an urdhva-reta, yet on seeing Mohini, semen was discharged. This implies that as long as there is semen in the body, it is sure to be discharged whenever a man associates with a woman in the jagrat state or svapna state. So then, as long as there is semen in the body, how can a person be called a perfect brahm- chari?"
73.9 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "That can be said to be a fault in Shivji's yogic powers. A person whose semen is discharged in the jagrat state or svapna state by the thought of a woman, cannot be called a true brahm- c hari. That is why in this whole world, Nar-Narayan Rushi is the only one who has firm brahm-charya. Since we have accepted the refuge of that Nar-Narayan Rushi, by his grace and by worshipping him, we shall also gradually become nishkami and perfect brahm-charis like Him.
73.10 "Yogis try to burn the semen, which remains in the body, with great effort. However, Shree Krishna Bhagvan maintained perfect brahm-charya, even in the midst of the company of women. Such powers are only present in Bhagvan. No one else is capable of remaining uninfluenced in this way. Therefore, other yogis should make an effort to avoid thinking of women in both the jagrat state and the svapna state."
73.11 Shuk Muni then asked, "In Dvarika, Shree Krishna Bhagvan had 16,108 wives. It is said that He had ten sons and one daughter by each wife. How should one understand this?"
73.12 Shreeji Maharaj clarified, "The incidents of Dvarika are one thing, and then incidents of Vraj are another. In Dvarika, Shree Krishna Bhagvan had adopted the philosophy of Sankhya. A follower of the Sankhya philosophy believes his own self to be distinct from the mind, body, and indriyas. While performing all actions, he does not regard himself as being the doer of those actions, nor does he experience either joy or grief from those actions. That was the principle adopted by Shree Krishna Bhagvan. Therefore, He was said to be uninfluenced. The Sankhya philosophy adopted by Shree Krishna Bhagvan in Dvarika is the very same Sankhya philosophy followed by kings such as Janak, who worshipped Bhagvan as grahasthas. In the same way, Shree Krishna Bhagvan was also a grahastha, and was known as the king of Dvarika. Therefore, because He followed the Sankhya philosophy, he remained uninfluenced as well.
73.13 "However, in Vrundavan Shree Krishna Bhagvan had adopted the philosophy of Yog, by which He maintained His vow of perfect brahm-charya, despite associating with women. At that time, He displayed the powers of Nar-Narayan Rushi within Himself. In the Shreemad Bhagvat, Kapil-Dev explains to Devhuti, 'No one, except Nar-Narayan Rushi, is capable of overcoming my maya in the form of women'. However, Shree Krishna Bhagvan conquered lust while associating with women.
73.14 "Now, consider the following incident: When Durvasa Rushi came and Shree Krishna Bhagvan began sending all the gopis with dishes filled with food for him, the gopis asked, 'How shall we cross the Yamunaji River?'
73.15 "At that time, Shree Krishna Bhagvan said, 'Tell Yamunaji that if Shree Krishna is forever a brahm-chari, then make way for us'. When the gopis said this to Yamunaji, she made way for them.
73.16 "After feeding Durvasa Rushi, all the gopis asked him, 'Yamunaji is in our way. How shall we return home?'
73.17 "Durvasa Rushi then asked, 'How did you come?'
73.18 "The gopis explained, 'We told Yamunaji that if Shree Krishna is forever a brahm-chari, then make way for us. So she made way for us. But how shall we return home now?'
73.19 "Durvasa Rushi then said, 'Tell Yamunaji that if Durvasa Rushi is forever fasting, then make way for us'. When the gopis said this to Yamunaji, she made way for them. Seeing this, the gopis were extremely surprised. However, they were unable to realise the greatness of Shree Krishna Bhagvan or Durvasa Rushi.
73.20 "Shree Krishna Bhagvan played with the gopis while maintaining His vow of perfect brahm-charya and was therefore still a brahm- c hari. Durvasa Rushi also united his atma with Shree Krishna Bhagvan, the atma of all, and although he ate all the food offered by the gopis, he was still forever fasting. This was because in reality, he had fed all the food to Bhagvan. Therefore, the actions of the extremely great cannot be understood.
73.21 "If a person looks for followers of the Sankhya philosophy, he could find thousands. However, to be an urdhva- reta by way of yogic powers, is only possible for Nar-Narayan. In addition, a true bhakta of Nar-Narayan can also gradually develop firm brahm-charya by the power of his worship, but others cannot.
73.22 "Furthermore, if semen is discharged through the genitals in the jagrat state or svapna state, a person cannot be called a brahm- c hari. Nevertheless, a person who follows the eight types of tyag of women is walking on the path of brahm-charya. So with time, by the grace of Nar-Narayan, he will gradually become a firm brahm- c hari.
73.23 "When I was young, I had heard that semen is also released through a person's sweat. So in order to retain my semen, I learnt two types of jal-basti, and also kunjar-kriya. In order to conquer lust, I learnt many yogic asans as well. When I slept at night, I slept in the posture of gorakh-asan to prevent the discharge of semen even in the svapna state. To conquer lust, I made such an effort that my body stopped sweating, and I no longer felt either the cold or the heat. Then, when I came to Ramanand Swami, he tried to make me sweat by pasting aval leaves all over my body. Even then, my body would not sweat. Therefore, conquering lust is the most difficult of all spiritual activities. However, a person who has the firm strength of upasana of Bhagvan's svarup, has become absolutely free from desires for the five vishays, and is firm in remaining free of worldly desires, becomes free of lust by the grace of Bhagvan."
73.24 Nityanand Swami then asked, "What is the method of becoming free of worldly desires? Is it listening to talks, or is it vairagya?"
73.25 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Vairagya alone cannot last; it is eventually destroyed. Therefore, after developing knowledge of the atma and complete gnan of Bhagvan's svarup, a person should think, 'I am the atma and sachidanand, whereas the body and the brahmand are mayik and perishable. How can they compare to me? Moreover, my ishta-dev is Purushottam Bhagvan, who is greater than even Akshar, and is the supporter of countless millions of brahmands. I have the firm refuge of that Bhagvan'. Vairagya developed from these thoughts, is said to be coupled with gnan. It is this vairagya that is never destroyed. For example, a burning flame is extinguished when water is poured over it. However, the vadvanal fire, which rests in the ocean, cannot be extinguished even by the waters of the ocean itself. Similarly, vairagya coupled with gnan is like the vadvanal fire and the fire of lightning – it cannot be extinguished. Without that gnan, other forms of vairagya cannot be trusted.
73.26 "My vairagya is like that of the fire of lightning and the vadvanal fire. This nature of mine is known by those who have stayed extremely close to me. However, those who remain far from me, are unable to realise my nature. Furthermore, this Mulji Brahm - Chari may appear to be naïve, yet he thoroughly knows my nature, and understands, 'Maharaj is as distant as akash. He has no prejudices against or in favour of anyone'. Also, because he knows my nature, he possesses qualities like those of Bhagvan. Moreover, the antaryami Bhagvan residing within all, explains to the minds of all men and women, 'There is no fault whatsoever in this Brahm-Chari'.
73.27 "The means of acquiring such great qualities is as follows: Whoever believes a great sant to be absolutely free of flaws becomes totally flawless himself. However, if a person perceives flaws in a great sant, that person's intellect becomes polluted, and inner enemies, like kam and krodh, all come to dwell within his heart. As a result, the heart of that person who perceives faults in the sat- purush is greatly troubled by disturbing thoughts. Although he may practice satsang, he never stops being unhappy.
73.28 "Those who are wise, realise all my characteristics by staying close to me. They realise, 'Maharaj has no affection for any object in this world that can awaken infatuation, such as wealth, women, jewellery, food, and drink. In fact, Maharaj remains distant from all these things. Also, when He allows someone to sit near Him or talks to him of gnan, it is purely out of compassion for the kalyan of the jeev'. On the other hand, those who are fools, whether they stay near or far, cannot understand my nature.
73.29 "These talks can only be understood by a person who has atma-nishtha, who offers bhakti to Bhagvan while holding His murti within the atma, and who does not abandon the worship of Bhagvan even after becoming brahm-rup. Therefore, after developing atma- nishtha and understanding the greatness of Bhagvan's murti, no desire for any objects remains. Once worldly desires are eradicated, a person may experience pain and pleasure according to the prarabdha of his body, but the indriyas no longer remain sharp.
73.30 "The indriyas are the jagged edges of the manomay chakra. They become blunt only by the complete understanding of brahm and Parbrahm. For example, if a person, whose teeth have become very sensitive as a result of sucking lemons, has to chew some chick-peas, he would never be able to chew them. If he was extremely hungry, he would at most swallow them, but he would be unable to chew them. Similarly, a person who has thoroughly understood the greatness of Bhagvan and the atma, feels no joy whatsoever in any of the pleasures of the vishays of any dham. While the prarabdha of the body continues, he may indulge in food, drink, and other objects, but he would do so in the same way as the person with sensitised teeth, swallowing whole chick-peas.
73.31 "To eradicate worldly desires is indeed an extremely difficult task. In fact, they remain even after mastering samadhi. After attaining samadhi, there is no way a person can return back into his body from the svarup of brahm. If he does return, it is because of one of three reasons. Firstly, he returns to his body from samadhi if he holds desires for worldly pleasures. Secondly, if someone is extremely powerful, he can enter into samadhi and return to the body according to his own will. Lastly, if there is another person who is much more powerful, then that person can bring someone back into their body from samadhi. These are the three ways of returning to the body from samadhi.
73.32 "When samadhi occurs, a person has the darshan of Brahm and sees the divine light of Brahm to be like that of countless millions of suns. At that time, if that person does not have much understanding, he regards the murti of pratyaksha Purushottam Bhagvan to be inferior, and believes Brahm to be superior. This leads to committing a breach of upasana. That is why firm nishchay should be developed in the pratyaksha murti, because only then can all things be accomplished. I am also determined that I shall not allow any flaw whatsoever to remain in anyone who sincerely surrenders his mind to me. Therefore, I shall not allow even a little distance to remain between us."
73.33 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "What are the characteristics of a person who has surrendered his mind, and what are the characteristics of a person who has not surrendered his mind?"
73.34 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a person, who has surrendered his mind to Bhagvan, is unable to be present while the talks of Bhagvan are going on, or for the darshan of Bhagvan, he experiences intense regret in his heart. Whenever he listens to the talks of Bhagvan and has the darshan of Bhagvan, his love for Bhagvan continually increases, but never does his mind recede from those talks and darshan. Moreover, when Bhagvan gives an agna to someone to stay far away, a person who has surrendered his mind would think to himself, 'If that agna was given to me, I would gladly go to Buranpur or Kashi, or anywhere else for that matter'. A person, who remains happy living according to the wishes of Bhagvan in this way, is near to me; even if he is a thousand miles away.
73.35 "On the other hand, a person who has not surrendered his mind in this way, is as good as being hundreds of thousands of miles away, even though he may be staying very close to me. In fact, I am afraid of even giving advice to a person who has not surrendered his mind to me, as I fear 'Will he accept it positively or negatively?' These are the characteristics of a person who has surrendered his mind and who has not surrendered his mind."

Satsang Flourishes Or Declines By The Wish Of Nar-Narayan
74.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on the morning of Vaishakh sud 11 [24th April, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead under the neem tree opposite the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan, in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
74.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The extent of a person's vairagya and understanding, can be measured only when he encounters vishays, or in times of hardship, but not otherwise. That being so, what can be said about situations of extreme happiness or hardship? For example, everyone must have realised the state of their own antah-karans during the minor difficulty that recently fell upon Dada Khachar."
74.3 Muktanand Swami then said, "It is natural that in a person's heart, he sides with Bhagvan's bhaktas, with the understanding that if satsang flourishes, many people will benefit; but if the satsang suffers a setback in any way, no one will benefit. That is why joy and grief are experienced."
74.4 Shreeji Maharaj said, "Since we are the das of Nar-Narayan, we should be pleased with whatever pleases Him. If it is the wish of Nar-Narayan, then our satsang will flourish; and if He wishes to make it decrease, then it will decrease. Also, if Nar-Narayan seats us on an elephant, we should be happy; and if He seats us on a donkey, then we should also remain happy. We should not have the slightest love for anything except the holy feet of Nar-Narayan. If there is a person who's mind is attached to just a minor responsibility, then what will become of him if he is given the major responsibility of taking care of the whole world?
74.5 "For this reason, our lord, Shree Nar-Narayan, performs tap while sitting under a bordi tree; and He does not touch anything that gives worldly pleasures. That is why we are the das of our lord, Shree Nar-Narayan. Just as a pati-vrata wife keeps jewellery, clothes, and food, less than her husband, we should keep less worldly pleasures than our Shree Nar-Narayan.
74.6 "If a bhakta wishes great things for Bhagvan, it is fine if he has these wishes while doing bhakti, and if he is nishkami. The bhakta should not wish these objects for himself. Bhagvan is not at all interested in the enjoyment of these worldly objects for Himself, but He sees the bhakti of the bhakta, and accepts the objects given by them.
74.7 "Bhagvan is the master of millions of universes, and the master of Brahmpur, Golok, and Vaikunth, and other dhams, and the master of Radhikaji and Lakshmiji. If Bhagvan desired worldly objects and enjoyments, why would He abandon all these things and sit under a bordi tree to perform tap? Therefore, Bhagvan can have no desire for worldly pleasures. In comparison to other avatars, our Nar-Narayan is a greater tyagi, and performs tap for the kalyan of jeevs.
74.8 "If Nar-Narayan has desires for worldly objects, then why does He eat berries and sit under a tree? There are many foolish souls in the world who are owners of land. If Nar-Narayan, who is Bhagvan, wanted some wealth and worldly pleasures, then should He not keep at least a few villages for His own use? However, Bhagvan does not want anything. Therefore, we should become a greater tyagi than our master.
74.9 "In whatever way satsang flourishes by the wish of Bhagvan, we should remain joyful. If it is the wish of Bhagvan, then the whole world will become satsangis; or if He so wishes, then satsang will decline. But, under no condition, should we have grief of joy in our minds. Whatever occurs is due to the actions of Bhagvan. So, just as a dry leaf blows in the air according to the direction of the wind, we should remain with Bhagvan and worship him, and never let any unhappiness enter our minds."

Redeeming Seventy-One Generations
75.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Vaishakh vad 11 [8th May, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a garland of yellow flowers around His neck, and was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
75.2 Sura Khachar then asked, "It is said that seventy-one generations of a family, which consists of a bhakta of Bhagvan, attain kalyan. But, many in that family may even be enemies of Bhagvan and His sant. In what way do they attain kalyan?"
75.3 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "Devhuti had profound love towards Kardam Rushi as her husband, yet she attained kalyan because of her love for him. The fifty daughters of Mandhata Raja who married Saubhari Rushi, were attracted to him because of his handsome appearance. Although their love for Saubhari was born out of lust, they still all attained kalyan like Saubhari Rushi himself. Therefore, if all the members of a family, in which there is a bhakta, believe 'We are indeed very fortunate to have a bhakta of Bhagvan in our family', and keep love for the bhakta with such an understanding of his greatness, then all the members of the family will attain kalyan. Even if the bhakta's ancestors, who have died and have gone to Svarg, realise 'We are indeed very fortunate to have a bhakta of Bhagvan in our family', and they also keep love for the bhakta, then those ancestors will attain kalyan as well.
75.4 "However, a person who keeps hatred towards a bhakta of Bhagvan, does not attain kalyan. As his hatred towards the bhakta increases, his mind becomes more and more polluted. In fact, when he dies, he falls into the same pit of Narak as that entered by a person who has committed the five great sins. Therefore, all those who have love for a bhakta of Bhagvan, regardless of whether they are family members or not, attain kalyan."
75.5 Then, Naja Bhakta asked, "Suppose there is one bhakta of Bhagvan with firm nishchay, and another with only a little nishchay. Although outwardly they both appear to be good, how can the two be recognised?"
75.6 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "A person who has precise gnan of the nature of the atma, firm vairagya, and perfect bhakti and svadharma, should be known to have perfect nishchay. Even if one of these four factors is lacking, then despite having nishchay, it is still without the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness. If all four factors are totally present, then that should be known as nishchay in Bhagvan coupled with the knowledge of His greatness."

A Person With Krodh, Irshya, Kapat, And Man
76.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on sud 11 of the first Jyeshth [23rd May, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was seated in His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, some senior sadhu s were seated before Him.
76.2 Shreeji Maharaj said, "There are four types of people I do not get along with, even if they happen to be bhaktas of Bhagvan: A person with krodh, a person with irshya, a person with kapat, and a person with abhiman. Of these, both krodh and irshya are dependent on abhiman. Furthermore, I can never believe a person with kam to be a satsangi. In fact, even if such a person happens to be in satsang, he is as good as a vimukh.
76.3 "A true satsangi is a person who has absolutely no flaws in following the panch-vartman, and who remains totally undisturbed until the end of his life, regardless of whatever strict commands I may impose, and force him to abandon his preferences and enforce my own. I effortlessly and naturally develop love for such a bhakta. On the other hand, I cannot develop love for a bhakta without these qualities, even if I try. This is because my nature is such that I can only develop love for a person who possesses perfect bhakti for Bhagvan in his heart."

Not Invalidating Dharma Under The Excuse Of Gnan
77.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on vad Amas of the second Jyeshth [10th July, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
77.2 In the sabha, the munis were engaged in a question-answer discussion amongst themselves. During the discussion, a muni, out of misunderstanding, began to invalidate dharma on the basis of his nishchay in Bhagvan.
77.3 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj commented, "A person who abandons dharma under the excuse of the gnan of Bhagvan, should be considered to be demonic. The svarup of Bhagvan possesses countless kalyan-kari qualities, which Pruthvi has described to Dharma in the first skandh of the Shreemad Bhagvat. Therefore, a person who has accepted the refuge of Bhagvan acquires these kalyan-kari qualities. Moreover, a person who has nishchay in Bhagvan also acquires the thirty characteristics of a sadhu described in the eleventh skandh of the Shreemad Bhagvat. Therefore, a person who does not possess the thirty characteristics of a sadhu should not be considered to be a true sadhu.
77.4 "Conversely, a person who does have nishchay in Bhagvan definitely does acquire the kalyan-kari qualities of Bhagvan within his heart. When these qualities of Bhagvan are acquired by a sadhu, he also acquires the thirty characteristics of a sadhu. From today onwards, whoever abandons dharma ( panch-vartman), and solely supports the strength of bhakti or gnan, is a blasphemer of the guru and guru's word. Anyone who even talks of such a lapse in dharma should be called a vimukh and told, 'You have sided with demons, and we shall not accept it'. With such words, the talks of that sinful person should be dismissed."
77.5 A sant then asked, "Maharaj, there may be an extremely faithful bhakta of Bhagvan who suffers great pain and who babbles meaninglessly at the time of death, whereas a person who does not seem to be a true bhakta appears extremely composed at the time of his death. In fact, he dies in comfort, realising the glory of Bhagvan, and even expressing His greatness. What is the reason behind this? Please explain why a religious person's death appears to be unpleasant in comparison to an ordinary person's death that appears to be pleasant?"
77.6 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "A person's mind is influenced by the eight factors of desh, kal, kriya, sang, dhyan, mantra, diksha, and shastra. If these eight factors are pure, the mind becomes pure; but, if they are impure, the mind becomes impure.
77.7 "Also, Bhagvan's maya inspires the dharmas of the four yugs to prevail in turn within a person's heart. At the time of death, if the dharma of Satya-Yug is prevalent, then death appears very pleasant. If the dharma of either Treta-Yug or Dvapar-Yug is prevalent, then death appears less pleasant. However, when the dharma of Kali-Yug is prevalent, death appears extremely unpleasant. In this way, the pleasantness and unpleasantness of death is also determined by kal.
77.8 "The three mental states – jagrat, svapna, and sushupti – are also factors. At the time of death, if the jagrat state is prevalent, then even a sinner would die while still completely conscious. If the svapna state is prevalent at the time of death, then a person dies mumbling without making sense, even if he is a bhakta of Bhagvan. Furthermore, if the sushupti state is prevalent at the time of death, then regardless of whether a person is a bhakta of Bhagvan or a vimukh, he passes away unconsciously, unable to say anything, neither good nor bad. However, if a person dies while thoroughly realising his jeevatma as greater than these three states and as being brahm-rup, he passes away displaying all the powers of Bhagvan. Passing away after becoming brahm-rup and displaying such powers, is only possible for bhaktas of Bhagvan. It is not possible for any vimukh. In this way, Kal, as well as the three mental states, determines the pleasantness and unpleasantness present at the time of death.
77.9 "However, even if a vimukh dies speaking normally, with the jagrat state being prevalent, that does not imply in any way that he will attain kalyan. Regardless of whether he dies pleasantly or unpleasantly, he will go only to Narak. Conversely, regardless of whether a bhakta of Bhagvan speaks normally, babbles without making sense, or remains silent at the time of death, he definitely attains kalyan. There is no doubt whatsoever in this fact. All bhaktas of Bhagvan should realise this. Although a bhakta of Bhagvan appears to be suffering pain when passing away, he actually experiences great bliss within due to the grace of Bhagvan. So, even if at the time of his death a bhakta passes away babbling without making sense, there should be no doubts at all regarding his kalyan."

The Affect Of Desh, Kal, Kriya, And Sang
78.1 In the Samvat year 1876, on Ashadh sud 3 [13th July, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes, and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He was also wearing a white pagh on His head and a garland of white flowers around His neck. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
78.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "All sant, please listen. I wish to ask a question."
78.3 The sants responded, "Please ask, Maharaj."
78.4 Shreeji Maharaj asked, "If the eight influences of desh, kal, kriya, sang, mantra, dhyan, diksha, and shastras are pleasant, they purify a person's mind. However, if these eight influences are unpleasant, they pollute a person's mind. But, do the sanskars of the karmas performed in past lives have any influence on these eight factors?"
78.5 The munis answered, "It seems that the karmas of past lives do play a role. If a person's past karmas are pleasant, he is born in a pleasant desh. However, if the past karmas are unpleasant, he is born in an unpleasant desh. In the same way, the other seven factors are also determined by past karmas. Therefore, past karmas appear to play a major role in all of them. The eight influences may be predominant in certain circumstances, but past karmas are predominant in all circumstances."
78.6 Shreeji Maharaj then questioned, "From what principle in the shastras do you claim that past karmas play the predominant role among all the eight influences? Please quote any reference from the shastras. After all, only in the Jain shastras, and not in any other, does a person find the predominance of only karmas. Other shastras explain only the predominance of the sang of Bhagvan and His bhaktas. Moreover, because you support the predominance of only past karmas, are you truly nastiks superficially disguised as satsangis, or what? This is because no one except the nastiks promote the predominance of karma s. They believe the Veds, the shastras, the Purans, and the Mahabharat, and other historical shastras, to be false. They only accept their own shastras, written in the Magdhi dialect, as authentic. Therefore, it is only out of foolishness that they only promote past karma s.
78.7 "If the eight influences vary according to past karma s, then why has the hundred-feet-deep underground water not risen to the surface for the many religious kings who have been born in the region of Marvad? If the influence of desh was controlled by past karma s, then the water-table should rise for people who have performed good deeds, and fall for sinners. However, this is not the case, because in the region of Marvad, both sinners and religious people suffer from the problem of water being found deep underground. In reality, each desh does not lose its natural characteristics. Therefore, the eight influences do not vary according to past karma s.
78.8 "Therefore, a person who desires his own kalyan should not uphold the predominance of karma s in the way that nastiks do. If the eight influences are unpleasant, he should abandon them and seek only pleasant influences.
78.9 "Moreover, just as pleasant and unpleasant desh exist outside the body, a person's body can also be a pleasant or unpleasant desh. If the desh (the body) is pleasant when the jeev resides within it, then kalyan-kari qualities such as nobility, contentment, compassion, and dharma, develop. However, if the desh (the body) is unpleasant when the jeev resides within it, then flaws such as kam, krodh, lobh, moh, mad, and matsar develop instead.
78.10 "Also, pleasant and unpleasant sang should be distinguished as follows: When no distance remains between a person and the sang he keeps, this is known as true sang. Outwardly, even enemies embrace each other, yet their hearts are hundreds of thousands of miles apart. Such outward sang cannot be called sang. Only sang that is kept by thought, word, and deed, can be called sang. A person should keep such sang – by thought, word, and deed – only with Bhagvan or His bhaktas, as it leads to the kalyan of a person's jeev. However, a person should never keep the sang of a sinner."
78.11 Then, at midday, Shreeji Maharaj called all the young, student sadhu s and requested, "All of you student sadhu s, please ask me questions."
78.12 Mota Shivanand Swami then asked, "How can a person who has firm nishchay in Bhagvan, be recognised?"
78.13 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person with firm nishchay in Bhagvan regards all actions performed by Bhagvan as kalyan-kari, whether they are good or bad. In fact, however many countless kinds of kriya a faithful bhakta witnesses, whether Bhagvan wins or loses or runs away, or whether He shows pleasure or grief, he says, 'All kriyas of Bhagvan are for the sake of kalyan'. If a bhakta speaks only in this way whenever he speaks, then he should be known to have absolute nishchay in Bhagvan."
78.14 Then, Nirmananand Swami asked, "How can a person prevent the development of a fault-finding attitude towards Bhagvan and His sadhu s?"
78.15 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "If a person possesses the previously mentioned firm nishchay in Bhagvan, then he never develops a fault-finding attitude towards Bhagvan. Furthermore, when he thinks of the greatness of the das of such a great Bhagvan, he never perceives faults in the bhaktas of Bhagvan either."
78.16 Then, Nirmananand Swami and Nana Pragnanand Swami both asked, "How can a person see the murti of Bhagvan in all the three mental states of jagrat, svapna, and sushupti?"
78.17 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If the pure sanskars from a person's previous lives are powerful, then he can constantly see the murti of Bhagvan in all three states. If a person, who continuously experiences fear, lust, or love for something, can see objects other than Bhagvan constantly in all three states, then what is surprising about being able to see Bhagvan constantly as well? He can definitely be seen."
78.18 Nana Shivanand Swami then asked, "How can a person with a stable foundation in satsang be recognised? That is the first question. The second question is: How can the enemies, like man, kam, krodh, lobh, mad, matsar, and irshya, be destroyed?"
78.19 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "A person who is absolutely loyal to satsang cannot at all tolerate someone speaking unkindly of satsang. For example, even though a person may have had a disagreement with a member of his family, he would be unable to tolerate anyone speaking unkindly of them. Therefore, just as a person is loyal to his relatives, if a person is similarly loyal to satsang, then his foundation in satsang is stable.
78.20 "The answer to the second question is as follows: If a person has such loyalty for satsang, how can he possibly hold man or irshya towards sant or satsangis? Therefore, all the inner enemies, like man, mad, matsar, and irshya, of a person who is loyal to satsang are destroyed. However, if a person does not have this loyalty for satsangis, and regards satsangis and kusangis as equal, then however highly he may be regarded in satsang, he is sure to become a vimukh."
78.21 Then, Nana atmanand Swami asked, "Bhagvan and His sant may boldly tell someone whatever needs to be said, with the belief, 'Whether he is praised or lectured, he will not fall from satsang in any way'. How can a person earn this trust of Bhagvan and His sant? That is one question. The second question is: How can a person win the love of all the sadhu s, just as he has won the love of the sadhu he is presently staying with?"
78.22 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "As in the answer to Shivanand Swami's question, if a person is extremely loyal to satsang, Bhagvan and His sant do not hesitate in lecturing him. They never lack faith in him, and they never feel, 'If he is lectured, he will leave satsang'. Instead, they have firm faith and believe, 'His satsang is firm, and so there is no danger in lecturing him'.
78.23 "The answer to the second question is: He may leave the person he was previously staying with because he was unable to get along with him, and subsequently go and stay with another person. Despite this, he is unable to tolerate others speaking unkindly of the person he originally stayed with. Therefore, all the sadhu s feel, 'This person is not ungrateful. He is a very good sadhu because he has not forgotten that he is thankful to the person from whom he has learnt even a little'. Realising this, all the sadhu s like him. On the other hand, if he speaks unkindly of the person he originally stayed with, all the sadhu s feel, 'This person is ungrateful. In the future, if he does not get along with any of us, he will surely speak unkindly of us too'. As a result, no one likes him."
78.24 Then, Daharanand Swami asked, "Bhagvan is greater than Akshar, mind and speech, and He is invisible to all. Then, why can everyone see Him as pratyaksha?"
78.25 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Bhagvan – who is beyond Akshar, mind and speech, and who is invisible – Himself, out of compassion, decides, 'May all the enlightened and unenlightened people in Mrutyu-Lok see me'. Having decided this, Bhagvan, who will always prevail, becomes visible to all people in Mrutyu-Lok out of compassion."
78.26 Tyaganand Swami then asked, "How is Bhagvan pleased?"
78.27 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "A person who wants to please Bhagvan should not wish for bodily comforts. He should not even crave for the darshan of Bhagvan. To do exactly as Bhagvan commands, is the only way to please Bhagvan."
78.28 Then, Lakshmananand Swami asked, "With what understanding is a person able to feel the wonder of having attained the profound association of Bhagvan and His sadhu s? Also, how can he feel joyful all day and night?"
78.29 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A bhakta realises, 'This Bhagvan and these sadhus all reside in Vaikunth, Golok, and Brahmpur. In fact, all of those dhams are present wherever Bhagvan and these sadhus reside. Therefore, I am extremely fortunate in that I am able to stay in the presence of these sadhus'. If he understands this, then he will experience happiness all day and night, and will sway in an ocean of bliss throughout the day."
78.30 Paramatmanand Swami then asked, "How can a person acquire the thirty characteristics of a sadhu described in the eleventh skandh of the Shreemad Bhagvat?"
78.31 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person who regards a sant, who possesses the thirty characteristics, as a guru and as a dev, and associates with him by thought, word, and deed, acquires those thirty characteristics. In fact, all the shastras state, 'When a person serves a sant, he becomes like the sant'."
78.32 Then, Shantanand Swami asked, "There is one bhakta who constantly maintains his vrutti on the svarup of Bhagvan. There is another bhakta who engages in bhajan and smaran, and also listens to and engages in katha and kirtans of Bhagvan. Which bhakta of Bhagvan is the better of the two?"
78.33 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "A person who experiences nirvikalp samadhi and is not conscious of his body, is the better of the two, even if he does not engage in katha and kirtans of Bhagvan. Also, there may be someone who is conscious of his body and gets up from worship of his own accord to eat, drink, and perform all bodily activities, and still does not listen to or engage in the katha and kirtans of Bhagvan. In comparison to him, a person who does listen to kathas and kirtans is better."
78.34 adharanand Swami then asked, "How should we behave so that Bhagvan and His sant become pleased?"
78.35 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If we strictly follow the panch-vartman, and do not allow any sort of failure in following them, Bhagvan and His sant will be pleased. There is not even the slightest doubt about this."
78.36 Then, Vedantanand Swami asked, "If a person has previously behaved improperly, what can a person do to please Bhagvan and His sant?"
78.37 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "Bhagvan and His sant become displeased upon seeing impure svabhavs within a person. When we develop a hate towards those svabhavs, a sant also realises this. This is because whenever a person has hatred towards someone, the whole world knows. As a result of this, a sant, who himself is also an enemy of those svabhavs, sides with us and imparts compassion upon us, showing us the way to conquer those svabhavs by whichever means possible.
78.38 "Therefore, after developing a bitter hatred towards root svabhavs that has led to a person's disgrace, he should adopt a method that would totally remove it. When we behave in this way, Bhagvan and His sant shower total compassion upon us. Whenever Bhagvan and His sant shower their compassion, a person continues to experience extreme bliss within his heart. Also, a person's ability to walk on the path of kalyan increases, and the strength of his enemies, such as kam, krodh and lobh, decreases. Therefore, Bhagvan does help a person who keeps intense hatred towards that bitter enemy which causes distress within his heart, which is why it is necessary to have hatred for the enemies, like kam and krodh. It is therefore very beneficial to develop hatred towards his enemies."
78.39 Then, Bhagvadanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, just as a person fears Bhagvan when he is near Him, what understanding should a person have so that he fears Bhagvan just as much when he is far from Him?"
78.40 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "Just as a person maintains the respect of Bhagvan when He is near, the same respect remains when He is far if he thoroughly understands the greatness of Bhagvan. The greatness should be understood as follows: 'Purushottam Bhagvan – who is greater than Akshar; by whose wish, countless millions of brahmands are created, and then supported by His powers; who is vyatirek, yet is present within everything as anvay, and while being anvay, is also vyatirek from everything; who dwells within each and every atom in His antaryami svarup just as He is in His pratyaksha svarup; without whose wish, not even a blade of grass is able to move; who is responsible for creating, sustaining, and destroying countless millions of brahmands; who administers pain and pleasure to the beings residing in these brahmands; who is the sole doer of all that happens, incarnates on this earth for the kalyan of the jeevs.
78.41 "'However, when that very Bhagvan mounts a horse, it appears that the horse is carrying Him. But in reality, it is Bhagvan who is the upholder of the horse. Furthermore, when Bhagvan sits on the earth, it seems that the earth is supporting Bhagvan, but in reality, it is Bhagvan who supports the entire earth along with its sthavar and jangam forms of life.
78.42 "'At night, the light of the moon, an oil lamp, or a torch allows a person to have the darshan of Bhagvan. During the day, the light of the sun allows a person to have the darshan of Bhagvan. In reality, however, it is that Bhagvan who provides light to the sun, the moon, and the flames of fire. These are the magnificent powers of Bhagvan. Despite this, Bhagvan has become like a human for the sake of the kalyan of the jeevs, and He is giving darshan to me'. If a person understands the greatness of Bhagvan in this way, then he can keep the same respect for Bhagvan when he is far from Him as when he is near Him."
78.43 Bhagvadanand Swami then asked another question: "Nothing happens without Bhagvan's will. Everything that happens is all the work of Bhagvan alone. So, when Bhagvan or His bhaktas encounter difficulties, why does He not ease their distress? Why does He wish to increase their distress?"
78.44 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "When Bhagvan assumes a human svarup, it is normal for Him to behave in absolutely the same way as humans do, and not reveal His alokik powers. This is how all the charitras of Bhagvan are described in the shastras. Therefore, a person may only have doubts when Bhagvan exhibits new charitras. But, as long as the charitras of Bhagvan are like those performed by the previous avatars, there should be no doubts in a person's mind."
78.45 Then, Nirmalanand Swami asked, "What understanding is required to thoroughly realise the greatness of a sant of Bhagvan?"
78.46 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "When a person thinks about the greatness of Matsya, Kurma, Varah, Vaman, Parshuram, Ram, Krishna, and the countless avatars of Bhagvan, and thinks, 'Bhagvan has freed countless jeevs through Ram, Krishna, and other avatars, and I am extremely fortunate that I have attained the profound association of a sant of that very Bhagvan', he begins to thoroughly realise the greatness of the sant day by day."
78.47 Then, Narayananand Swami asked, "How is the jeev anvay with the three bodies of sthul, sukshma, and karan, and how is it vyatirek from them?"
78.48 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "When the body encounters pleasures and pain, and the jeev takes on that pleasure and pain upon itself, the jeev is anvay with the three bodies. When it believes itself to be distinct from the pleasures and pain of the three bodies, then the jeev is vyatirek from them."
78.49 Shunyatitanand Swami then asked, "When a person initially practices satsang, he has deep love for sant and satsangis. But, why does this love later decline?"
78.50 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "Initially, he holds very high respect for a sant. Later, when he perceives a minor avgun in the sant, he regards it as a minor avgun because of his own malicious mind. As a result, his vicious nature flourishes, and his respect for the sant declines. Then, if he thoughtfully eradicates this vicious nature, he becomes as pure as he was before. However, if he does not do so, he will ultimately become a vimukh."
78.51 Prasadanand Swami then asked, "What is the cause of the jeev's moksh?"
78.52 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "To do exactly as a sant says without having any doubts, is the only cause of the jeev's moksh."
78.53 Then, Trigunatitanand Swami asked, "What methods should a person adopt when faced with unpleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang?"
78.54 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The only way to overcome unpleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang, is to escape from them by any means possible."
78.55 Nana Nirvikaranand Swami then asked, "Despite having nishchay in Bhagvan, why is a person's vasna not eradicated?"
78.56 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person's vasna is not eradicated because he has not fully realised the greatness of Bhagvan."
78.57 Then, Mota Yoganand Swami asked, "Despite having perfect nishchay in Bhagvan, why does a person still not develop love for Bhagvan and the kathas of Bhagvan?"
78.58 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "It is because he has not yet realised the greatness of Bhagvan as it is. If a person thoroughly realises the greatness of Bhagvan, then he does not develop love for anything else besides Bhagvan, even if he tries. In addition, he develops constant love only for Bhagvan, His sant, and the kathas and kirtans of Bhagvan."
78.59 Then, Pratoshanand Swami asked, "How can a person's bhakti towards Bhagvan remain constant?"
78.60 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a person thoroughly understands the greatness of pratyaksha Shree Krishna Purushottam – who is the cause of the four avatars of Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Sankarshan, and Vasudev, and who is the cause of the twenty-four avatars – then he remains steady in the nine types of bhakti towards Bhagvan, like smaran and kirtan."
78.61 After answering the questions of all the munis in this way, Shreeji Maharaj asked them all, "Kam, krodh, and lobh are the three gateways to Narak. All of you please reveal if you have thoroughly conquered any of these."
78.62 The munis then spoke about the ones they had conquered. Hearing this from the munis, Shreeji Maharaj became extremely pleased. After happily imprinting His holy feet on the chests of atmanand Swami, Yoganand Swami, Bhagvadanand Swami, and Shivanand Swami, He added, "Just as Mahanubhavanand Swami and the others, are senior munis, these four munis should also be considered senior along with them. Therefore, do not allow anyone to insult them."
78.63 Having advised Muktanand Swami and the other senior sadhu s in this way, Shreeji Maharaj bid "Jay Sachidanand" to everyone and returned to His residence for His meal."


Shree Sarangpur Prakaran

Sarangpur – 1
Conquering The Mind
1.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Shravan vad 5 [28th August, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
1.2 Then, Muktanand Swami asked a question: "The shlok 'jitam jagat ken mano hee yen' explains that a person who has conquered the mind has conquered the whole world. But, how can a person know whether the mind has been conquered?"
1.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "When the indriyas withdraw from the panch-vishays ( shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh) and no desire to indulge in those vishays remains, then all the indriyas are said to be conquered. Also, when the indriyas do not come into contact with the vishays, the mind also does not come into contact with the indriyas, and its vrutti remains within the heart. In this way, a person who has rejected the panch-vishays with absolute determination should be known as having conquered his mind. But, if a person does have some love for the vishays, then even if he has conquered his mind, it should not be known as having been conquered."
1.4 Again, Muktanand Swami asked, "Can the vishays be defeated by vairagya, or are they defeated by love for Bhagvan?"
1.5 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "One way to defeat the vishays is atma- nishtha, and the other is the realisation of Bhagvan coupled with the knowledge of His greatness. Specifically, atma- nishtha should be of the following type: 'I am chaitanya, while the body is jad; I am pure, whereas the body is impure; I am imperishable, while the body is perishable; I am the embodiment of bliss, whereas the body is the embodiment of misery'. In this way, when a person realises the atma to be totally distinct from the body in every way, he will never consider himself to be the body nor will he have love for the vishays. That is how the vishays are restrained through knowledge of the atma.
1.6 "Also, a person should think of the greatness of Bhagvan in the following way: 'I am the atma, while pratyaksha Bhagvan, whom I have attained, is Paramatma. I have attained Shree Purushottam Bhagvan in person, the very Purushottam Bhagvan who is the lord of Golok, Vaikunth, Shvet-Dvip, and Brahmpur, as well as the master of Brahma and the other devs, who themselves are the lords of countless millions of brahmands. That Paramatma forever resides in my atma. I would discard all of my pleasures for the vishays of countless millions of brahmands, just for one second of darshan of that Bhagvan. Moreover, if a person were to gather together all the pleasures of the vishays of countless millions of brahmands, even then it would not equal even one millionth of a fraction of the bliss which is present in just one pore of Bhagvan. In fact, in the Moksh-Dharma, it is said that the loks of the other devs are like Narak, compared to the Akshardham of Bhagvan. It is that very Bhagvan whom I have attained in His pratyaksha svarup. So how can I possibly discard Him and wish for the pleasures of the vishays, which are like the pits of Narak? The pleasures of the vishays are nothing but the embodiment of misery'. So, the vishays can be restrained by realising Bhagvan's greatness in this way.
1.7 "The vairagya generated by knowledge of atma and Paramatma is such that it eradicates desires of the pleasures of all vishays. A person who has rejected the pleasures of the vishays by developing an understanding in this way, never again develops love for the vishays. Only such a person's mind can be said to be conquered.
1.8 "Without this understanding, it may appear that a person has love, but when he encounters an appealing vishay, he abandons Bhagvan and develops love for that object. Or, if he develops love for his son or wife, or he suffers an illness, or the pleasures of the vishays disappear, then his love for Bhagvan decreases, and he becomes confused. Just as a dog's puppy appears cute when it is young, the bhakti of such a person initially appears to be good, but ultimately it does not remain appealing."

Sarangpur – 2
Developing Love For Bhagvan
2.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Shravan vad 6 [29th August, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting facing north, on a decorated bedstead which had been placed on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was wearing a white khes and had tied a white pagh around His head. He had also covered Himself with a white pachhedi. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
2.2 Then, addressing the munis, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please begin a question-answer discussion amongst yourselves."
2.3 Svayamprakashanand Swami then asked, "How can a bhakta of Bhagvan develop intense love for the murti of Bhagvan?"
2.4 The munis then attempted to answer the question amongst themselves, but were unable to give a precise answer.
2.5 So, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Love can develop due to beauty, due to lust, due to greed, due to some selfish motives, or due to the other person's qualities. Of these, love which stems from beauty lasts only until a person sees the disfigurement caused by leprosy in the other person's body, or until the person develops leukoderma. After that, the love which once existed would dissolve. In the same way, love stemming from greed, lust, and selfishness also eventually dissolves. However, love developed due to the other person's qualities, ultimately survives."
2.6 Then, Somla Khachar asked Shreeji Maharaj, "Which qualities are these? Are they external ones, or internal ones?"
2.7 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "How is it possible to develop love due to external qualities? To be more precise, it is love stemming from the qualities of the person's speech, thoughts, and deeds, which does not dissolve. Now, are you asking only about a bhakta developing love for Bhagvan? Or, are you also asking about Bhagvan developing love for the bhakta?"
2.8 Svayamprakashanand Swami clarified, "We are asking about both."
2.9 Shreeji Maharaj then began to explain by saying, "A person should not hurt any living being with his speech. Also, during a question-answer discussion where principles are being debated with Bhagvan and a senior sadhu, those who are junior should give in to those who are senior. Also, in a sabha, he should not ask questions that may embarrass a sadhu who is senior to himself. Instead, he should purposely accept defeat before Bhagvan and a senior sadhu, regardless of whether it seems appropriate or inappropriate. Of these, he would not doubt an appropriate agna. But, even if it seems inappropriate and leads to doubts, he should not refuse to abide by it, at least at that time. He should certainly agree and say, 'Maharaj, I will do just as you say'. If that agna is such that he cannot accept it, and if it is the wish of Bhagvan and a senior sadhu to hear his plea, then he should fold his hands before them and say with bhakti, 'Maharaj, the agna which you gave me is fine, but I have certain doubts about it'. In this way, he should speak modestly. However, if it is not really the wish of Bhagvan to hear his plea, then he should say to a senior sadhu or a bhakta who is close to Him, 'Although Bhagvan has given such an agna, I simply cannot accept it'. Then, the senior sadhu would find a compromise regarding that agna. However, regardless of whether the agna seems appropriate or inappropriate, he should not immediately refuse to abide by it. He should use politeness to delay the following of the agna given by those who are senior, but when initially told, he should not immediately refuse. This is how a person should behave regarding the qualities of speech. As a result, Bhagvan and the senior sadhu develop love for that bhakta, and the bhakta also develops strong love towards Bhagvan.
2.10 "Next, how should a person behave physically? Well, if his body seems to be hyperactive, he should weaken it by engaging in bhajan or by keeping the chandrayan vrat. Then, on noticing this, it is well and good if Bhagvan or a senior sadhu takes care of his body. However, he should knowingly take care of his own body. Also, he should physically serve Bhagvan and His bhaktas. When Bhagvan or a great sadhu notices a person behaving in this way physically, they develop love for him, and that bhakta also develops love for Bhagvan.
2.11 "Now, I shall describe the way in which a person should behave regarding the qualities of the mind. When a bhakta does darshan of Bhagvan, he should do so with a focused mind and concentrated vision. Instead, when a person, or a dog, or some other animals, or a bird, disturbs him while he is performing darshan of Bhagvan, then his vrutti is broken from Bhagvan's darshan. He begins to glance here and there, up and down, and also see them at the same time. Bhagvan and the senior sadhus are not at all pleased upon seeing a person with such wandering vision.
2.12 "When such a bhakta does perform darshan, how does he do it? Well, he does it just as any ordinary person does. A person who has such an ordinary vision, should be known to be like a squirrel that squeaks and raises its tail at the same time. He performs darshan of Bhagvan and notices other objects at the same time. When he begins to perform darshan in such an ordinary way, he does not remain as devout as he previously was, and he declines day by day. Therefore, while performing darshan of Bhagvan a person should not look from side to side.
2.13 "The novelty and divinity experienced in a person's heart at the time of the first darshan of Bhagvan, should remain exactly the same. Moreover, he should look at the murti with a fixed gaze, and then closing his eyes, he should internalise that murti, exactly as it, is in his heart. For example, in Dharmapur, Kushalkunvar-Bai did my darshan, and at the same time, closed her eyes and internalised the murti in her heart. Similarly, a person should perform darshan with an attentive mind and a fixed gaze, but he should not perform darshan as other ordinary people do. If, along with the darshan of Bhagvan, he also looks at the other people, or cats, or dogs, then when he has a dream, he sees not only Bhagvan, but also those other objects. That is why a person should perform darshan of Bhagvan with a fixed gaze, and not with a wandering gaze.
2.14 "A person who performs darshan of Bhagvan while keeping his sight under control, will feel that darshan to be continually new. In addition, he would also feel any agna that Bhagvan may have given, to be new. On the other hand, a person who performs darshan superficially, with a ordinary vision, would feel Bhagvan's darshan and agna to be ordinary. Although he may perform darshan every day, for such a person it is as if he has not performed darshan at all. When such a person engages in bhajan, his mind would not remain stable. Specifically, when he attempts to concentrate on Bhagvan while his thinking is dispersed, other objects he may have seen would spontaneously come into his mind, along with Bhagvan. Therefore, a person should perform darshan only of Bhagvan. The mind of this person remains only on Bhagvan during bhajan and smaran. His thinking does not become dispersed. Instead, it becomes concentrated.
2.15 "Furthermore, I am able to determine when a person is performing darshan with wandering eyes. A great sadhu whose own sight and mind are kept under control also realises, 'This person is performing darshan in a superficial way'. A person who performs darshan in such an ordinary way, then begins to decline from satsang day by day.
2.16 "For example, a man who is overcome by kam fixes his gaze on a beautiful woman with a focused mind. At that time, if some animal or bird were to pass by or make a noise, he would not notice it. In the same way, a person should attach himself to Bhagvan with a similarly focused gaze, but he should not perform darshan in an ordinary way."
2.17 Then, Nirvikaranand Swami raised a doubt, "Maharaj, we have to travel and speak to people all over the country. As a result, our mind does not remain concentrated."
2.18 In reply, Shreeji Maharaj questioned, "I have given an agna for you to speak to people, but when have I ever given an agna for you to ignore the darshan of this murti and perform darshan of other things?"
2.19 Having said this, Maharaj continued, "The same divinity that a person feels when he has darshan of the murti of Bhagvan for the first time, can be retained if he keeps his mind and gaze fixed on Bhagvan. So, when he behaves in this way, in accordance with the qualities of the mind mentioned previously, then the love that Bhagvan has for that bhakta remains renewed. Moreover, the love which that bhakta has towards Bhagvan also constantly remains renewed.
2.20 "Also, both the eyes and ears should especially be kept under control. This is because worldly talks are prevalent everywhere. If a person is attracted towards them through the vrutti of the ears, and he listens to them, then all of those worldly words would be recalled when he attempts to engage himself in bhajan. Furthermore, anything seen by a person who has a wandering gaze, is also recalled during bhajan. That is why both of these indriyas should be kept strictly under control. However, while performing darshan of Bhagvan's murti, if the vrutti of person's eyes and ears leaves the murti aside and is attracted towards other things, he should lecture them, by saying, 'O fools! What are you going to achieve by looking at svarups other than Bhagvan, and by listening to words other than the talks of Bhagvan? As of yet, you have not attained siddh-dasha where you can instantly receive whatever you wish. This is because you are still in the process of attaining siddh-dasha. As a result, you are not going to be able to obtain those vishays that you desire. So, why are you pointlessly grasping for them and leaving Bhagvan aside? Moreover, even if you were to attain some insignificant vishay, then due to the sin incurred as a result, there will be no end to the beatings you will receive in Yampuri'. In this way, a person should tell off his eyes and ears.
2.21 "A person should also tell them, 'When you become stabilised in the murti of Bhagvan, you will attain siddh-dasha in this very life. As a result, you will be able to naturally hear any talks occurring in any brahmand. If you desire to have a charming svarup like that of Brahma, Vishnu, or Shiv, then you will be able to attain such a svarup. Or, if you wish, you will become a bhakta like Lakshmi or Radhika. Moreover, while worshipping Bhagvan, if you do not attain siddh-dasha in this very life, you will attain siddh-dasha after death when you become a mukta. However, without attaining siddh-dasha, even if you constantly look at some beautiful object until you die, you will still not be able to attain that beauty; and even if you listen to worldly talks until you die, you will still not attain anything. Instead, your mind will become extremely polluted by it'. In this way, a person should advise his eyes and ears, and keep them fixed only on the murti of Bhagvan. A person, who behaves in this way, increasingly develops love for the murti of Bhagvan day by day. As a result, Bhagvan's love and the great sadhu's love for that bhakta, also increases day by day."

Sarangpur – 3
'Shravan', 'Manan', 'Nididhyas', 'Sakshatkar' - Mansi Puja
3.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the evening of Shravan vad 7 [30th August, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was wearing a white khes and had tied a white pagh around His head. He had also covered Himself with a black-bordered khes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
3.2 Svayamprakashanand Swami then asked Shreeji Maharaj a question: "Maharaj, suppose there is a bhakta who physically performs puja of pratyaksha Bhagvan with various types puja items. Also, suppose there is another bhakta who performs mansi puja of Bhagvan using various imaginary items. Of the two, which bhakta is better?"
3.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a person lovingly performs puja of Bhagvan, with hair-raising sentiments and an emotion-filled voice, then regardless of whether he performs physical puja or mansi puja, both are superior. On the other hand, if he performs puja mechanically – without feeling love or excitement, and without showing emotion in his voice – then regardless of whether he performs physical puja of Bhagvan or mansi puja of Bhagvan, both are inferior."
3.4 Then, Somla Khachar asked, "By what characteristics can a person recognise a bhakta who becomes overwhelmed with love while performing physical puja or mansi puja of Bhagvan?"
3.5 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Such a person has intense shraddha in performing the puja of Bhagvan and serving Him, in listening to katha s and talks related to Bhagvan, and in singing kirtans. He also understands the profound greatness of Bhagvan. With each passing day, both of these two aspects remain renewed, but never diminish. For example, Muktanand Swami's shraddha and understanding of Bhagvan's greatness are exactly the same today and just as new as they were when I first saw him in Lojpur. They have not diminished in any way whatsoever. In the same way, such a bhakta should be recognised by these two characteristics.
3.6 "All the Yadavs who stayed with Shree Krishna Bhagvan, did not have such shraddha or understanding of Bhagvan's greatness. They served Him just like they would serve other kings. Therefore, they did not achieve fame and are not even regarded as bhaktas. On the other hand, Uddhavji served Shree Krishna Bhagvan with shraddha and an understanding of His greatness, and therefore he has been described as a great bhakta of Bhagvan and has been extremely renowned in the shastras and in the world."
3.7 Then, Nirvikaranand Swami asked, "Maharaj, what are shravan, manan, nididhyas, and sakshatkar?"
3.8 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "To listen to a talk through the ears, is known as shravan. Then, after hearing the talk, to mentally think over the talk, and to discard parts of the talk which are not needed and to retain the parts of the talk which are useful, is known as manan. Then, after having mentally retained the talk with nishchay, the practice of continuously recalling the talk day and night is known as nididhyas. Finally, when that talk is recalled exactly as it was, with absolute clarity and sincerity, it is known as sakshatkar.
3.9 "If a person engages in shravan, manan, and nididhyas about the svarup of the atma, then he will attain sakshatkar of the atma. Furthermore, if a person engages in shravan, manan, and nididhyas of Bhagvan, then he will attain sakshatkar of Bhagvan. Sakshatkar cannot be attained by doing shravan alone, without practicing both manan and nididhyas.
3.10 "If a person does not practice manan and nididhyas following the darshan of Bhagvan's murti, then even if he performs darshan for thousands of years, he will not attain sakshatkar of that murti. This is because this kind of darshan is like having done only shravan. On the other hand, if a person has had darshan of Bhagvan's entire body, and has then done manan and nididhyas of all the parts of His body, then he will be able to easily recall those parts even today. Conversely, a person who has performed only darshan of Bhagvan's body would be unable to recall it, even if he attempted to recall it.
3.11 "Also, there are some bhaktas who say, 'We sit in meditation and try very hard to recall Maharaj's murti, yet we cannot visualise even a single part. Then, how can we possibly envision the whole murti?' The reason for this is the same as above – they merely perform darshan of the murti, without doing manan and nididhyas. So, how can it be visualised? After all, if a person has merely seen even a worldly object with his eyes, or merely listened to it with his ears, and it is not later mentally recalled, it will be forgotten. Then, how can he expect to remember the murti of Bhagvan, which is divya and not worldly, without doing manan and nididhyas?
3.12 "Therefore, if a person continuously engages in manan and nididhyas after performing darshan of Bhagvan and listening to His talks, then he will attain sakshatkar of them. Otherwise, even if he performs darshan and shravan for the rest of his life, he will still not attain sakshatkar."

Sarangpur – 4
atma And Non- atma
4.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Shravan vad 8 [31st August, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting facing north on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was wearing a white khes, and had tied a white pagh around His head. He had covered Himself with a white pachhedi. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
4.2 Svayamprakashanand Swami then asked a question: "Maharaj, how should a person clearly understand the distinction between the atma and non- atma, which will never cause him to mistake atma and non-atma to be one?"
4.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "That which is understood clearly is beneficial – whether it is understood by one verse, or by two verses, or by five verses, or by a hundred verses, or even by a thousand verses. So, once a person has developed such a clear understanding, no misconception remains about the atma and non- atma being one. Furthermore, only such clear understanding leads to happiness, whereas a foolish understanding does not lead to happiness. Therefore, a person should clearly understand, 'I am the atma, and not a single one of my characteristics can be found in the body. Also, not one of the characteristics of the body – which is jad, full of misery, and perishable – can be found in me, since I am chaitanya'. After making such a distinction and becoming totally free of worldly desires, a person should believe himself to be chaitanya and then think of Purushottam Bhagvan. Distinguishing between that which is jad and that which is chaitanya in this way should be known as true wisdom.
4.4 "However, a person who believes himself to be the atma for a while, but then believes himself to be the body for a while and fantasises about women, should be known as a fool. He will not experience happiness in his heart. For example, there may be some delicious food which is comparable to amrut , but if just a small amount of poison were to be mixed with it, then that food would never give a person pleasure, but would in fact lead to misery. In the same way, a person may think of that atma all day, but if he believes himself to be the body and fantasises about women, even for just a moment, then all of his thoughts are useless. Therefore, a person should think only of the atma, so he can become totally free of worldly desires.
4.5 "Now, someone may doubt: 'What will become of me if I do not become totally free of worldly desires and happen to die in that imperfect state?' Well, a bhakta of Bhagvan should never think like that. Instead, he should realise, 'If anything dies, it is this body. But as I am that atma, which does not age and is immortal, I will never die'. Having developed such an understanding, he should maintain courage, keep a firm mind, and discard all desires other than those of Bhagvan.
4.6 "Then, in the process of eradicating worldly desires in this way, if a few desires do remain, he will attain the Naraks described in the Moksh- Dharma. Specifically, if a bhakta of Bhagvan retains any desires for the world, then he attains the loks of Indra and other devs. After migrating to those loks, he experiences the pleasures of apsaras, heavenly vehicles, palaces decorated with jewels, and other luxuries – which are like Narak, in comparison to the dham of Bhagvan. However, a bhakta of Bhagvan does not go to Yampuri, like a vimukh, nor does he re-enter the cycle of births and deaths.
4.7 "Therefore, even if a bhakta of Bhagvan has worldly desires, if nothing else, he will become a dev. Then, having become a dev, he will become a human again. As a human, after offering bhakti to Bhagvan and becoming free of worldly desires, he will ultimately attain the dham of Bhagvan. But, he will not have to suffer from the miseries of Narak or the cycle of births and deaths, like the vimukh. Bearing this in mind, a bhakta of Bhagvan should not become discouraged on seeing the force of worldly desires. Instead, he should joyfully continue to worship Bhagvan, continue in his attempts to eradicate his desires, and maintain absolute faith in the words of Bhagvan and His sant."

Sarangpur – 5
Worldly Desires Are Defeated By Bhakti
5.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Shravan vad 9 [1st September, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
5.2 Then, Muktanand Swami asked a question: "Which method of eradicating worldly desires is so powerful that it alone incorporates all other methods?"
5.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The worldly desires of a person will be eradicated, if he has the following four characteristics in his heart: shraddha, faith in the words of Bhagvan and His bhaktas, love for Bhagvan, and the knowledge of the greatness of Bhagvan's svarup. Of these, if the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness is extremely powerful and the other three – shraddha, faith, and love – are weak, they will also become extremely powerful. On the other hand, although a person may appear to have intense bhakti, if it is not coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness, it will ultimately be destroyed. For example, a ten-year-old girl who has contracted tuberculosis will certainly die before she matures into a young woman. Similarly, a person whose bhakti lacks the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness will find that his bhakti will be destroyed before it matures.
5.4 "Furthermore, if a person has bhakti for Bhagvan in his heart coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness, then even though he does not possess any other kalyan-kari qualities, they will still develop in his heart. Conversely, if a person does not have bhakti in his heart coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness, then even though he possesses kalyan-kari qualities, such as tranquillity and self-restraint, they are as good as being absent because they will ultimately be destroyed.
5.5 "Therefore, even if a person has only bhakti coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness, his worldly desires will still be eradicated, and all the kalyan-kari qualities will develop and reside within his heart. Bhakti of Bhagvan coupled with the knowledge of His greatness is the greatest and most reliable method to eradicate a person's worldly desires."
5.6 Then, Svayamprakashanand Swami asked, "What is the anvay nature of the jeev, and what is its vyatirek nature? What is the anvay nature of ishvar, and what is its vyatirek nature? How should Purushottam Bhagvan be known in His anvay form, and how should He be known in His vyatirek form?"
5.7 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "When the jeev is said to experience births and deaths, that should be known as the jeev's anvay form. When the jeev is said to be achhedhya, abhedhya, and avinashi, that should be known as the jeev's vyatirek form.
5.8 "When ishvar behaves as one with its three bodies of virat, sutratma, and avyakrut, that should be known as the anvay form of ishvar. When ishvar is described as sachidanand, and as greater than its body (the brahmand), that should be known as the vyatirek form of ishvar.
5.9 "The anvay form of Akshar is the inspirer of Prakruti- Purush and all the devs, such as Surya, and Chandra. The form in which there is not even a trace of the influence of Prakruti- Purush, and in which only Purushottam Bhagvan resides, should be known as the vyatirek form of Akshar.
5.10 "The anvay form of Purushottam is that which resides in the hearts of both bound jeev s and released jeev s as their witness. However, He remains untouched by such states of bondage and release. In the same way, He also resides in the hearts of ishvars and Akshar as their witness, but He remains unaffected by their influence. The form that is greater than jeev, ishvar, and Akshar should be known as the vyatirek form of Purushottam. These are the anvay- vyatirek natures of the various entities."
5.11 Again, Muktanand Swami asked, "Does the importance of Bhagvan's darshan, the importance of chanting His holy name, and the importance of the touch of Bhagvan, apply only to the bhaktas of Bhagvan, or does it also apply to all beings?"
5.12 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "The modes of darshan are certainly different, so please listen as I explain them to you. When a person does darshan of Bhagvan with his eyes coupled with his mind, then that darshan could not be forgotten, even if he tired to forget it. In the same way, if the skin is coupled with the mind when he touches Bhagvan, then that touch will also not be forgotten. For example, the Shreemad Bhagvat narrates the words spoken by the gopis to Bhagvan: 'O Bhagvan! Since the day we touched your feet, all the pleasures of the world, apart from you, have seemed like poison to us'. Similarly, when all the gnan-indriyas are coupled with the mind and are then engaged in darshan, listening, and touching, the experiences are never forgotten.
5.13 "To give another example, an ignorant person who indulges in the vishays when the five gnan- indriyas are coupled with his mind, can never forget them, even if he wants to forget them. Similarly, only that darshan of Bhagvan, and listening to the talks of Bhagvan, which have been done with the mind engaged, should be known as darshan and listening.
5.14 "On the other hand, a person may do darshan, but it is as good as not having done darshan at all. This is because at the time he was doing darshan, his mind was wandering elsewhere. As a result, he will certainly forget that darshan within a day, or maybe within five days, or maybe within fifty days, or maybe within six months, or maybe after one year, or after five years; eventually, it will not remain.
5.15 "Therefore, only a person who engages the five gnan- indriyas (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin) coupled with the mind, in the darshan and touch of Bhagvan with intense love and the understanding of His greatness, attains the fruits of that darshan and touch. Others, who have the darshan and touch of Bhagvan, attain only the seeds. However, the real importance applies only to those who engage in the darshan and touch, coupled with the mind."

Two States Within Each Of The Three Mental States - The Four Types Of Speech
6.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Shravan vad 10 [2nd September, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
6.2 Then, Nityanand Swami asked, "How do the mental states remain within each of the other mental states?"
6.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The 'state' is where the jeevatma dwells, when it indulges in the vishays. There are three types of mental states: jagrat, svapna, and sushupti.
6.4 "Of these, the jagrat state is the result of the sustenance state of Virat-Purush. It is full of sattva-gun and is located in the region of the eyes. In that jagrat state, the jeevatma is known as vishva. Moreover, with the consciousness of its sthul body, via the ten indriyas and the four antah-karan s, the jeevatma appropriately and carefully indulges in the pleasures of the external vishays according to its past karmas. This is known as the jagrat state, in which sattva-gun is predominant.
6.5 "Within the jagrat state, if the jeevatma indulges in the pleasures of the external vishays inappropriately due to some misconception, then that is known as the svapna state within the jagrat state. In the jagrat state, if the jeevatma indulges in the pleasures of the external vishays irresponsibly, due to grief or fatigue, then that is known as sushupti within the jagrat state.
6.6 "The svapna state is the result of the creation state of Hiranyagarbh. It is full of rajo-gun and is located in the region of the throat. In that svapna state, the jeevatma is known as taijas. With the consciousness of its sukshma body, via the indriyas and antah-karans, the jeevatma indulges in pleasurable and miserable vishays, which are temporary, according to its past karma s. This is known as the svapna state, in which rajo-gun in predominant.
6.7 "Within the svapna state, if the jeevatma knowingly indulges in the pleasures of the temporary vishays carefully and with awareness, exactly as it does during the jagrat state, then that is known as the jagrat state within the svapna state. However, if in that svapna state the jeevatma, due to sluggishness, does not recognise those temporary vishays which it experiences, then that is known as the sushupti state within the svapna state.
6.8 "The sushupti state is the result of the destruction state of ishvar. It is full of tamo-gun and is located in the region of the heart. When the jeev is in that sushupti state, the vruttis of the indriyas and the antah-karan, the desires for the pleasures of the vishays, and its sense of knower-ship and doer-ship, all become merged in the karan body. When the jeevatma, which has the consciousness of its karan body, and is known as pragna, remains fully absorbed in the bliss of sagun brahm in the form of Pradhan- Purush, it is known as the sushupti state, in which tamo- gun is predominant.
6.9 "Within the sushupti state, if a sense of doer-ship develops due to the impressions of a person's karma s, then that is known as the svapna state within the sushupti state. Then, opposing realisation of that sense of doer-ship – which disrupts the bliss of sushupti on account of the agony of the pain experienced during jagrat and svapna – is known as the jagrat state within the sushupti state.
6.10 "In this way, the other two states reside within each individual state. Also, that which gives knowledge of these distinctions between the states to the jeevatma, and who gives the jeev the rewards of its karma s accordingly within those states, is known as turyapad, as the antaryami, as the drashta, as Brahm, and also as Parbrahm."
6.11 Again, Nityanand Swami asked, "How should a person understand the four types of speech – 'para', 'pashyanti', 'madhyama', and 'vaikhari'?"
6.12 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "That is a vast, as well as an extremely subtle subject, but in the eleventh skandh of the Shreemad Bhagvat, Shree Krishna Bhagvan explains it to Uddhavji. Please listen as I explain it in brief.
6.13 "At the time of the first creation, after entering the thousand-petalled lotus which lies on the head of Virat- Purush, Purushottam Bhagvan produced the ancient divine sound – like the sound of Akshar- Brahm. Then, via the sushumna path, that divine sound pervaded the navel of Virat- Purush. Then, along with maha-pran, it rose upwards, and caused Virat- Purush's lotus-navel – which was previously facing downwards – to face upwards. In this way, the divine sound produced in the navel of Virat- Purush is known as the 'para' speech. For the purpose of creating the Veds, Bhagvan Himself has inspired that 'para' speech. Therefore, it is like a seed. That 'para' speech is like a stream of light, and is the cause of the 'ardhamatra'.
6.14 "From there, the 'para' speech reached the hruday- akash of Virat- Purush, where it was known by the name of 'pashyanti'. From there it reached the region of the throat and became known by the name of 'madhyama'. From there, it reached the mouth of Virat-Purush and received the name of 'vaikhari'. It then became the form of pranav by becoming the three sounds of 'A', 'U', and 'M'. It then became the fifty-two syllables, and took the form the four Veds. In this way, a person should understand the four types of speech in Virat- Purush – 'para', 'pashyanti', 'madhyama', and 'vaikhari'.
6.15 "Now, I shall describe these four types of speech which also dwell within the body of the jeev, so please listen. That same Purushottam Bhagvan resides in the jeev as antaryami. He is independent, yet interwoven with the three mental states of the jeev. That same Bhagvan assumes an avatar on this earth for the kalyan of the jeevs. At that time, those jeev s describe the svarup of that Bhagvan as well as His dham s, qualities, and divine powers. They describe His divya charitras, make a distinction between atma and non- atma, and also individually explain the differences between jeev, ishvar, maya, Brahm, and Parbrahm. Such speech is known as 'para'. Speech that gives a complete explanation of mayik worldly entities and vishays is known as 'vaikhari'. Speech that gives an incomplete explanation, and creates confusion of mayik worldly entities and vishays, is known as ' madhyama'. Finally, speech which blindly describes those mayik worldly entities and vishays as being the same, and which cannot be understood, is known as 'pashyanti'.
6.16 "In this way, the details of the four types of speech can be known in the jagrat state of the jeev. The details of those four types of speech in the svapna and sushupti states can only be known by a person who has mastered samadhi – it cannot be known by others."

Naimisharanya Kshetra
7.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Shravan vad 11 [3rd September, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
7.2 In the sabha, Shreeji Maharaj had requested the first skandh of the Shreemad Bhagvat Puran to be read. During the reading, the following statement was encountered: 'Wherever the jagged edges of the manomay chakra are worn away, that place should be known as Naimisharanya Kshetra'. Hearing this, Muktanand Swami inquired, "Maharaj, what exactly is the manomay chakra, and what should a person understand its jagged edges to be?"
7.3 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "A person should understand the mind to be the manomay chakra, and the ten indriyas to be its jagged edges. Wherever those jagged edges of the mind (the indriyas) wear away and become blunt, that place should be known as Naimisharanya Kshetra. Religious deeds ( jap, tap, vrat, dhyan, and puja) commenced in that place flourish rapidly, day by day. Furthermore, that Naimisharanya Kshetra should be known to be wherever Bhagvan's ekantik sant resides.
7.4 "When the jagged edges of the manomay chakra are worn away, no affection remains towards any of the panch-vishays. Then, even if a person sees a beautiful woman, or extremely attractive clothes, or jewellery, a strong hatred develops towards them deep within his mind. However, the vruttis of indriyas would never cling to them.
7.5 "For example, when an extremely sharp arrow pierces and lodges into its target, it cannot be removed. However, if that same arrow, with its tip removed so that only its shaft remains, were to be shot at a wall, it would rebound and fall to the ground. It would not penetrate the wall like the sharp-tipped arrow. Similarly, when the jagged edges of the manomay chakra (the indriyas) are worn away, then no matter how appealing the vishays may be, the vruttis of the indriyas would not be drawn towards them. Instead, they would rebound like the blunt arrow-shaft. When a person is able to behave in this way, the jagged edges of the manomay chakra can be said to have been worn away.
7.6 "So, a person should seek kalyan wherever he sees such a Naimisharanya Kshetra in the form of the association of a sant, and he should remain there with an absolutely firm mind."

The Characteristics Of Irshya
8.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Shravan vad 12 [4th September, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
8.2 Chaitanyanand Swami then asked, "Maharaj, what are the characteristics of irshya?"
8.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Irshya develops from the man that a person holds within his heart. In fact, krodh, matsar, and asuya also arise out of man. But the characteristic of irshya is that a person cannot tolerate someone greater than himself being honoured. A person who has such a nature should be known to have irshya with his heart. Moreover, a person who has extreme irshya cannot tolerate anyone's greatness."

Sarangpur – 9
The Prevalence Of The Dharma Of The Yugs
9.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Shravan vad 13 [5th September, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj walked from Sarangpur and arrived at Kundal to please His haribhaktas. There, He was sitting facing north on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Amra Patgar's home. He had tied a white pagh around His head. He had covered Himself with a white pachhedi, and was wearing a white surval and white angarkhu. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
9.2 Muktanand Swami then asked, "Maharaj, why do the dharmas of the yugs prevail in a person's heart?"
9.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The dharmas of the yugs prevail because of the three gun. When pure sattva-gun is prevalent, Satya-Yug prevails in the heart. When rajo-gun is prevalent, Treta-Yug prevails in the heart. When rajo-gun and tamo-gun are prevalent together, Dvapar-Yug prevails in the heart. Finally, when tamo-gun alone is prevalent, Kali-Yug prevails in the heart. In this way, the prevalence of the yugs is due to the gun."
9.4 Muktanand Swami asked further, "What causes the activities of the gun?"
9.5 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The cause of the activities of the gun are karma s. Specifically, the type of karma s a person has performed previously, determines the gun that will prevail. Therefore, if a person, in whom rajo-gun and tamo-gun are prevalent, attempts to perform dhyan on Bhagvan, he will not be able to do so. In such situations, he should make use of the strength of atma- nishtha and Bhagvan's greatness. He should realise, 'I am the atma. Since I am gunatit, there can be no mayik influence within me'. Furthermore, he should realise Bhagvan's greatness in the following way: 'Ajamel was a terrible sinner and yet, because of his son, he uttered the name of "Narayan". As a result, he was freed from all his sins and attained Akshardham. I have attained that Bhagvan in His pratyaksha svarup, and I chant His holy name day and night. Therefore, I am fulfilled'.Thinking in such a way, he should always remain joyful.
9.6 "However, a person in whom rajo-gun and tamo-gun are prevalent should not insist on performing dhyan. Instead, he should engage in bhajan and smaran as much as possible. Moreover, he should physically serve Bhagvan and His sant with shraddha. At the same time, he should abide by his dharma and believe himself to be fulfilled."
9.7 Again, Muktanand Swami asked, "Kali-Yug prevails in the heart of a person who has accumulated many tamasi karmas. Is there any method to eradicate those karmas, or not?"
9.8 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "If he has intense shraddha and extremely firm faith in the words of Bhagvan and His sant, then whatever type of tamasi karmas he may have performed, they will be destroyed. The dharma of Kali-Yug will also vanish, and the dharma of Satya-Yug will prevail. Therefore, if a person practices satsang with absolute honesty, then no fault will remain in his heart, and he will become brahm-rup in this very lifetime."
9.9 Then, Svayamprakashanand Swami asked, "What can be called sthan?"
9.10 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "An individual's dharma according to the four varnas and the four ashrams should be known as sthan. You are all tyagis, but if you were to leave this ashram and tread the path of grahasthas, then you would be known to have diverted from your sthan. So, even in the most difficult circumstances, or even if I were to issue an agna, you should not deviate from your dharma. Moreover, while grahasthas wish to perform my puja by offering clothes and jewellery, you should not wish to do so. Instead, you should offer puja by using leaves, flowers, fruits, and water, and you should experience joy by performing this puja. It would not be appropriate for you to deviate from your dharma to perform puja of Bhagvan. Therefore, all of you should remain within your own dharma, and offer puja within your capacity. This is my agna, so abide by it firmly."

Dharma And Adharma
10.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Shravan vad 14 [6th September, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was walking with all the sadhu s from Kundal and, along the way, they arrived at Khambhda. They settled themselves under a pipal tree. The people of the village then brought a decorated bedstead for Shreeji Maharaj to sit upon. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sadhu s, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the sadhu s were singing kirtans.
10.2 Shreeji Maharaj then asked the sadhu s to stop singing, and addressed the village people, "In this world there are two types of people: Those who follow the path of honesty ( dharma) and those who follow the path of sin ( adharma). Of these, the person who follows the path of honesty, abandons stealing, adultery, slander and all other forms of sin. Fearing Bhagvan, such a person remains within the disciplines of dharma. As a result, everyone in the world trusts him, be it a member of his family or anyone else; and whatever he says is accepted by all as the truth. A person who follows dharma, likes the company of a true sant.
10.3 "On the other hand, a person who follows the path of sin( adharma), is engrossed in evil deeds such as stealing, adultery, eating meat, drinking alcohol, changing someone's varna and ashram by force, and having his own varna and ashram changed by force. As a result, no one in the world ever trusts him. In fact, even his own relatives do not trust him. Such a sinful person never likes the company of a true sant; and if someone else were to keep the company of a sant, the sinful person would spite him too.
10.4 "Therefore, a person who aims to attain kalyan, should not follow the path of sin ( adharma). Instead, he should follow the path of honesty ( dharma), and keep the company of a true sadhu. As a result, he would certainly, without a doubt, attain kalyan."
10.5 Hearing this talk, many people of the village accepted the refuge of Shreeji Maharaj.
10.6 Shreeji Maharaj then returned to Sarangpur, and sat on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
10.7 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "If a person looks at the dham s of Bhagvan – Golok, Vaikunth, Shvet-Dvip, Brahmpur – from a physical perspective, they appear to be very far away. However, if a person looks at them from the atma's perspective, they are not even an atom's distance away. Therefore, the understanding of a person who views from a physical perspective is false, and the understanding of a person who views from the perspective of the atma is true. In reality, Bhagvan and the dham of Bhagvan are not even an atom's distance away from a sadhu who believes, 'Bhagvan is forever present in my chaitanya. Just like the jeev resides in the body, Bhagvan resides within my jeev. My jeev is the sharir, and Bhagvan is the shariri of my jeev'. Such a sadhu also believes that his jeevatma is distinct from the three bodies – sthul, sukshma, and karan – and that Bhagvan forever resides within his atma. Such a sant is like a mukta of Shvet-Dvip. When a person has the darshan of such a sant, he should realise, 'I have had the darshan of Bhagvan Himself'. A person who has such an understanding has nothing more to attain.
10.8 "If a person is unable to attain such an understanding, then he should maintain profound associations with a sant. If that sant were to daily beat him five times with a pair of shoes, he should still tolerate such insults. In no way should he abandon his association with a sant, just as an opium addict cannot abandon his addiction. Such a person should be known to be equal to the sant mentioned earlier. Also, whatever that sant attains, a person who continues to profoundly associate with such a sant, also attains."

Sarangpur – 11
Personal Effort
11.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Shravan vad Amas [7th September, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
11.2 Then, Muktanand Swami asked a question: "Personal effort is mentioned in the shastras, but how much is actually achieved by personal effort, and how much is achieved by Bhagvan's grace?"
11.3 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "A person who, by the words of a sadguru and the shastras, has attained firm vairagya, has firm shraddha, strictly follows the eight types of brahm-charya, has affection towards ahinsa, and absolutely firmly realises himself to be the atma, is relieved of the burden of births and deaths which hangs over his head. Then, just like a grain of rice that has had its outer chaff removed does not grow, a mukta who has the gun just mentioned, is freed from eternal ignorance in the form of maya. He is therefore freed from the cycle of births and deaths, and attains the state of atma- nishtha. This much can be achieved by personal effort.
11.4 "Bhagvan's grace is only bestowed upon a person who has these characteristics. When he attains the grace of Bhagvan, he becomes an ekantik bhakta. Even the Shruti s state: niranjanaha paramam samyam-upaiti" The meaning of this Vedic shlok is that a person who is free from the blemishes of maya, attains qualities similar to those of Bhagvan. Just as Bhagvan is never bound by any pure or impure karma s that He may perform, the mukta is also never bound by pure or impure karmas.
11.5 "Due to her love, Lakshmiji sometimes becomes absorbed in Bhagvan's murti, whereas on other occasions, while remaining separate from Bhagvan, she remains in Bhagvan's seva. In the same way, out of intense love, the bhakta also sometimes becomes absorbed in Bhagvan, and at other times he is separate and remains in Bhagvan's seva. Moreover, just as Bhagvan is independent, that bhakta also becomes independent. These powers can only be attained by the grace of Bhagvan."
11.6 Then, Nityanand Swami asked, "Bhagvan's grace is bestowed upon a person who has absorbed all these characteristics perfectly. But, what becomes of a person who has some deficiency in developing these characteristics?"
11.7 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a person has a deficiency in any of the qualities of vairagya, brahm-charya, shraddha, ahinsa, and atma- nishtha, then he does not attain atyantik moksh, and Bhagvan's Akshardham. Instead, he attains some other dham of Bhagvan. If he has even more worldly desires remaining, he attains the loks of the devs. In the Moksh- Dharma, these loks are described as being like Narak compared to the dham of Bhagvan. Then, after being a dev, he returns to being a human, and from being a human he again becomes a dev. anek-janma-sansiddh-stato yati param gatim : A yogi who has become siddh after many lives, attains Akshardham." This shlok explains that a bhakta of Bhagvan who has worldly desires does not go to Narak, nor does he have to undergo births and deaths in the cycle of 8.4 million life-forms. Instead, he takes innumerable births as a dev and a human being. Then, only when he develops the previously described qualities of vairagya, brahm- charya, shraddha, ahinsa, and atma- nishtha, does he become worthy of attaining the grace of Bhagvan. He then becomes an ekantik bhakta of Bhagvan, and attains His gunatit dham, Akshardham.
11.8 "So, whether it takes one life or innumerable lives, only when a person develops the previously described characteristics and becomes extremely free of worldly desires, does he become worthy of attaining the grace of Bhagvan, and only then will he attain atyantik moksh. Without it, he will definitely not attain it."
11.9 Then, Nrusinhanand Swami asked, "Is there a method by which a person can eradicate all of his deficiencies within this very lifetime?"
11.10 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a person becomes extremely vigilant and determined, then all of his deficiencies can be eradicated within this very lifetime. If his deficiencies have not been eradicated while he is alive, and if he were to become free of worldly desires and develop intense love for Bhagvan during his last moments, then even in those last moments Bhagvan would shower His grace upon him, and he would attain the dham of Bhagvan.
11.11 "Therefore, whether after one life, or after countless lives, or even in the last moments before a person dies, should a bhakta's vruttis become intensely focused on Bhagvan, no deficiency would remain in that bhakta."

Sarangpur – 12
Thinking About The atma
12.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Bhadarva sud 1 [8th September, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
12.2 Then, Nirvikaranand Swami asked a question: "Which qualities constantly remain in a sadhu, and which qualities come and go?"
12.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "First, there is atma- nishtha; second, there is svadharma; and third, there is nishchay in the svarup of Bhagvan. These three qualities constantly remain in a sadhu, whereas others may come and may go. Therefore, while other qualities come and go, these three qualities will always remain."
12.4 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "Why is it that even after understanding the distinction between the body and the atma, a person forgets that distinction, and continues to identify himself with the body?"
12.5 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "Once a person has clearly understood the distinction between the body and the atma, it cannot be forgotten. Even if he believes, 'I am the body', he can no longer accept himself as the body. Also, once he has firmly established the belief of Bhagvan, even if he tries to reject it, it cannot be rejected. Furthermore, the belief that his understanding of 'I am an atma' has been lost, and the belief that 'I am the body' has begun to prevail, is simply a misconception of his mind. The belief never actually returns. Such a bhakta with perfect gnan is conscious only of his atma. Also, he believes his atma to be brahm-rup, and that Purushottam Bhagvan, who is Parbrahm, forever resides in that brahm-rup atma. In addition to this, his belief of Bhagvan remains forever steady."
12.6 Then, Svayamprakashanand Swami asked, "How should a person think of his atma?"
12.7 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "When the drashta (the jeevatma) focuses on the antah-karan, it becomes unaware of the outer sthul body, and all the vishays related to it. Then, with the thought that rests between the antah-karan and the drashta, a person should realise the nature of the man, the buddhi, the chitt, and the ahankar. A person should then observe the various immoral thoughts within the antah-karan. Then, only when those immoral thoughts end, should a person perform dhyan on Bhagvan's murti. However, as long as those immoral thoughts and desires persist, a person should keep observing them, but he should not perform dhyan at that time.
12.8 "In addition, when the five gnan- indriyas of the outer sthul body are drawn towards their respective vishays, a person should think in two ways: Firstly, he should think about the vishay towards which the indriyas have been drawn. Secondly, he should think about the drashta who watches from the organ of the indriya. Then, when the first thought of the vishay and the second thought of the drashta merge into one, his vrutti becomes completely detached from the vishays. However, if he does not think in this way and attempts to break his vrutti from the vishays forcefully, then the vrutti's attraction towards the vishays will not be eradicated. On the other hand, if he withdraws his vrutti by applying this thought process, his vrutti will never again become attached to the vishays. Therefore, as long as the vruttis of a person's indriyas have affection for the vishays, he should avoid performing dhyan of Bhagvan. Only when the vruttis of the indriyas become stable should he perform the dhyan of Bhagvan.
12.9 "Also, when the drashta is active in the outer sthul body, a person should be absolutely clear in making the distinction that when he is active in the sthul body, he should never look towards the desires arising in the sukshma body; and when a person is active in the antah-karan, he should become unaware of his sthul body. Moreover, using the thought which rests between the drashta and drashya, he should realise, 'The drashta and drashya are absolutely distinct'. With this understanding, a person should assign the features of the body, to the body, and the features of the drashta, which is chaitanya, to chaitanya. Also, childhood, youth, old age, fatness, thinness, birth, and death, are all aspects of the body. Therefore, they should never be thought of as belonging to the atma. On the other hand, being achhedhya, abhedhya, not aging, immortal, full of gnan, blissful, and eternal, are all aspects of the atma. They should in no way be considered to belong to the body. Instead, those characteristics should be understood to belong to the atma.
12.10 "These thoughts should not be abandoned as long as desires and immoral thoughts persist in the antah-karan. Take the example of a king: As long as he is confronted by an enemy, he cannot preside on his throne in peace, nor does he indulge in any pleasures. Only when all of his enemies are conquered, does he enjoy the luxuries of his kingdom. Similarly, a bhakta of Bhagvan should firmly keep these thoughts, as long as the enemies (his mind and indriyas) continue to trouble him. Only when all the desires of his mind and indriyas have diminished, should he perform dhyan of Bhagvan."

Losing Nishchay And Not Losing Nishchay
13.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Bhadarva sud 2 [9th September, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
13.2 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "Can a person who previously had nishchay in Bhagvan, but later lost it, really be said to have had nishchay in the first place?"
13.3 Svayamprakashanand Swami replied, "If a person has developed nishchay in his jeevatma, he would not lose it by any means. However, if his nishchay is based on the writings in the shastras, then when Bhagvan performs some action that is not mentioned in the shastras, he would lose his nishchay in Bhagvan."
13.4 "Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj then said, "In the shastras, there are an endless variety of talks describing Bhagvan as being powerful as well as weak, as being the all-doer as well as a non-doer. So then, which action not mentioned in the shastras could Bhagvan possibly have performed, which causes a person to lose his nishchay? Please answer this question."
13.5 The munis replied, "No action of Bhagvan is outside the shastras. So, what is the reason behind a person developing nishchay and then losing it?"
13.6 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "It is only through the shastras that a person develops nischay. This is because the shastras describe the characteristics of Bhagvan as well as the characteristics of a sant. So, only nishchay developed through the shastras remains firm. On the other hand, nishchay developed by a person's own mind, without the help of the shastras, eventually dissolves.
13.7 "The shastras are also the inspiration behind the activities of dharma. The fact that an ignorant person, who has never heard the shastras, has been able to follow the disciplines of dharma to this day, in the form of making distinctions between his mother, sister, daughter, and other women, is due to the shastras. How is that? Well, it has been passed down through the generations after someone initially heard the talks from the shastras. From that, it has spread throughout society through successive generations. Therefore, a person who develops nishchay in Bhagvan and loses it afterwards has no nishchay in the words of the shastras. Such a person is stubborn and a nastik.
13.8 "On the other hand, if a person does have nishchay in the shastras, he would never turn away from Bhagvan. This is because the shastras describe an endless variety of charitras of Bhagvan. So, regardless of which actions Bhagvan performs, it will never be outside of the shastras. Therefore, only a person who has nishchay in the shastras is able to develop unshakeable nishchay in Bhagvan, and only such a person attains kalyan. In addition, such a person would never deviate from dharma."

Laziness And Infatuation
14.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Bhadarva sud 3 [10th September, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting facing west on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was wearing a black-bordered, white khes, and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a white pagh around His head. Bunches of yellow flowers were placed above His ears, and tassels of yellows flowers had been placed upon His pagh. In addition to this, a garland of yellow flowers was hanging from His neck down to His navel. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
14.2 Svayamprakashanand Swami then asked a question: "It is said in the Geeta that once a bhakta attains the dham of Bhagvan, such as Vaikunth, he never falls back from it. But, which flaw causes some to fall back?"
14.3 Shreeji Maharaj asked in return, "Who has attained the dham of Bhagvan and then fallen back? Give me even one example!"
14.4 Svayamprakashanand Swami replied, "First of all, there are Jay and Vijay, the parshads of Bhagvan who fell from Vaikunth. Then, there are Radhikaji and Shreedama, who fell from Golok."
14.5 Shreeji Maharaj then clarified, "Jay and Vijay did fall, but it was only because Bhagvan wanted to illustrate the glory of a sadhu. If a person insults a sadhu, like the Sanakadik, then even if he has attained a dham like Vaikunth, he can still fall from it. That is why they fell. In addition, Jay and Vijay did return to Bhagvan's dham, Vaikunth, in their third life. Therefore, they cannot be said to have fallen; it happened because it was Bhagvan's wish. In any case, a person can only be said to have fallen when he never again retains any contact with Bhagvan.
14.6 "Also, when Radhikaji fell from Golok, that too was by Bhagvan's wish, as He Himself wished to incarnate in a human body to uplift countless jeev s and perform kalyan-kari actions. Therefore, if someone claims that Radhikaji fell, then Bhagvan could be said to have fallen along with her. That is why she cannot be said to have fallen, because it was Bhagvan's wish that they both came to earth from Golok. So, in this instance, it should be recognised as being the wish of Bhagvan only.
14.7 "Of course, if it is His wish, a mukta may incarnate in a body even from Akshardham. Moreover, by His will, that which is jad can become chaitanya, and that which is chaitanya can become jad. After all, Bhagvan is extremely powerful, and whatever He wishes, occurs. Therefore, no one who has attained the dham of Bhagvan falls back from it without it being Bhagvan's wish. However, a person who does fall, is a worldly incomplete bhakta, who falls during the course of his spiritual activities. Such a person is called 'yog-bhrasht'. In contrast, those who have become siddh through vairagya, atma- nishtha, bhakti towards Bhagvan, and brahm-charya, are equal to the muktas of Shvet-Dvip. They never fall."
14.8 Having explained this, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Now, I shall ask a question."
14.9 The munis responded, "Please do ask."
14.10 Shreeji Maharaj said, "In the Udyog-Parva of the Mahabharat, Sanat-Sujat Rushi says to Dhrutrashtra, 'He who abandons both laziness and infatuation has completely disobeyed Bhagvan's maya. In fact, laziness and infatuation are maya itself'. Now, we are known to be tyagi bhaktas of Bhagvan. If someone amongst us has laziness and infatuation, and if that person is not particularly vigilant in eradicating them by using the strength of Bhagvan's glory, then what type of bliss does such a bhakta experience in this body? Also, what type of bliss does he attain after he dies? That is my question."
14.11 Svayamprakashanand Swami replied, "A person who is a bhakta of Bhagvan need not worry too much if his laziness and infatuation are not eradicated by the deep thought of Bhagvan's glory."
14.12 Shreeji Maharaj then questioned, "What is wrong with a bhakta of Bhagvan who has laziness and infatuation and is vigilant in his efforts to eradicate them? What makes a person who is not so vigilant better than the person who is?"
14.13 Svayamprakashanand Swami explained, "That bhakta of Bhagvan relies on the strength of Bhagvan, not on the strength of his spiritual activities. That is why he is better."
14.14 Shreeji Maharaj questioned further, "You are claiming that a person who is careless, despite the enemies of laziness and infatuation being prevalent in him, is superior. Well, consider the example of a pati-vrata wife. Due to the fear of her husband, and the fear of preserving her pati- vrata dharma, she remains very conscious in her mind, in case she smiles at or touches another man. Moreover, in her mind lies the following fear: 'If I behave freely, my husband will think of me as an adulteress, and will no longer accept my seva. This would be a breach of my pati-vrata dharma'. Bearing this in mind, she remains ever vigilant. So, you are claiming that a bhakta who keeps bhakti just like the pati-vrata wife and who is conscious in his efforts to eradicate laziness and infatuation is at fault. Furthermore, you are suggesting that a bhakta who is not concerned about eradicating laziness and infatuation, like a woman who flirts with any man she fancies, and is not concerned about preserving her fidelity, is actually superior! Is this because of a misunderstanding on your behalf, or what?
14.15 "Remember, if a person remains careless, then even if he is a bhakta of Bhagvan, the two enemies of laziness and infatuation would not fail to hinder him. For example, when a person drinks alcohol or bhang, then just as a vimukh becomes intoxicated, a bhakta of Bhagvan would also become intoxicated and delirious. In the same way, just as alcohol and bhang in the form of laziness and infatuation affect a vimukh, they affect a bhakta of Bhagvan as well. However, the only difference between a vimukh and a bhakta of Bhagvan is that a vimukh cannot eradicate these two enemies, whereas a bhakta can overcome them if he remains vigilant in his efforts. That is the advantage a bhakta of Bhagvan has. Nevertheless, he is not better if he remains careless, even if he is a bhakta of Bhagvan."
14.16 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked another question: "How many elements is the sthul body composed of, and how many elements is the sukshma body composed of? Are there equal elements in both, or does one have more or less than the other? Please describe the nature of these two bodies."
14.17 Svayamprakashanand Swami attempted to answer the question, but was unable to do so adequately. Then, all the munis said, "Maharaj, please be kind enough to answer this question yourself."
14.18 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "The sthul body is composed of the five tattvas known as the five maha- bhuts, such as pruthvi and jal. The sukshma body is composed of nineteen tattvas: the five gnan- indriyas, the five karma- indriyas, the five prans, and the four antah-karan s. Yet, only when the sukshma body is interwoven with the sthul body, can all activities be carried out properly, but not otherwise. This is because only when the sukshma body, together with the indriyas, joins the sthul body – which includes the organs of the indriyas, such as the eyes and ears – can the vishays of those indriyas be indulged in. This is not possible by the organs of the indriyas of the sthul body alone. Therefore, the sukshma body composed of the nineteen tattvas is interwoven with the sthul body composed of the five tattvas (five maha-bhuts). That is why the sthul body is also said to be composed of twenty-four tattvas.
14.19 "In the same way, the pleasures of the sukshma body can only be indulged in when the sukshma body behaves as one with the sthul body, which is composed of the five tattvas. That is why the sukshma body, which is composed of nineteen tattvas, is also said to be composed of twenty-four tattvas. Moreover, because the sthul body is inherent within the sukshma body, when a person associates with a woman through his sukshma body, he ejaculates semen from his sthul body. Therefore, there is unity between the sthul body and the sukshma body during the jagrat state and the svapna state."
14.20 Then, the munis remarked, "Maharaj, this suggests that the sukshma body is the same as the sthul body. So, just as there is an effect of karma s on the sthul body, is there a similar effect on the sukshma body as well? Or is there a difference?"
14.21 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a person has just as strong a belief that the sukshma body is 'mine', as he has that this sthul body is 'mine', then the law of karma s would apply to the sukshma body just as it does to the sthul body. Indeed, it is only to encourage the individual that the karma s of the sukshma body have been said to be insignificant.
14.22 "In comparison, neither the sthul body nor the sukshma body of a person who has no consciousness of his sthul and sukshma bodies, is affected by karma s. This is because such a person behaves only as the atma. Therefore, a person who has such atma- nishtha, remains unaffected by karma s related to the sthul and sukshma bodies. Nonetheless, such a person would never physically perform any impure karma s. Furthermore, he endures any joy or pain resulting from his prarabdha. Even while experiencing them, he believes, 'I am not the one who experiences. I am the atma'.
14.23 "On the other hand, a person who is ignorant and who perceives himself with the body, is affected by all karma s related to the sthul and sukshma bodies, and therefore he experiences joy and pain according to his karma s. This is because an ignorant person, while experiencing whichever vishays he indulges in, believes the body to be his true svarup, and feels, 'I am the one who experiences these vishays'.
14.24 "Then, in his final moments, such an ignorant person sees yamduts. He then becomes unaware of his body and enters a state of unconsciousness. The yamduts force him to leave his body and therefore separate his jeev. The jeev then receives the body of an evil spirit, in which it suffers the torments of Yampuri. In comparison, a bhakta of Bhagvan possessing gnan, sees Bhagvan or His sant in his last moments. He also becomes unaware of his body and enters a state of unconsciousness. However, when that bhakta discards his body and becomes separate from it, Bhagvan grants him a divya body like that of Bhagvan, with which he resides in the dham of Bhagvan."

Sarangpur – 15
Mugdha, Madhya, And Praudha Gopis
15.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Bhadarva sud 4 [11th September, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
15.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I shall ask a question. There are two types of bhaktas of Bhagvan: A person has such deep love for Bhagvan that he cannot bear even a second without His darshan. His love is very obviously noticeable. Another bhakta of Bhagvan possesses knowledge of the atma as well as total vairagya. He also has love for Bhagvan, but his love does not appear to be like the love of the first bhakta. Furthermore, although the first bhakta's bhakti is extremely appealing, he possesses neither knowledge of the atma and vairagya, but his bhakti is not as appealing as the first bhakta's. Of these two bhaktas, whose bhakti is superior, and whose bhakti is inferior? That is the question."
15.3 To this, Svayamprakashanand Swami replied, "He who has intense love for Bhagvan is better, even if he does not have knowledge of the atma and vairagya."
15.4 Shreeji Maharaj then questioned, "With what understanding do you say that he who does not have knowledge of the atma and vairagya is better? Such a person believes himself to be the body, and so whenever he comes upon any of the panch-vishays that comfort his body, he will develop affection for them. As a result, his love for Bhagvan will diminish. So why do you consider him to be superior?"
15.5 Svayamprakashanand Swami clarified, "I do not consider the person who develops affection for the vishays to be a bhakta who loves Bhagvan. Instead, I consider the person who is like the gopis to be such a bhakta."
15.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The gopis were not so naïve. They were so wise that their wisdom could go beyond the understanding of those who do possess knowledge of the atma and vairagya. They also spoke as expressively as those who are educated in diplomacy. In addition, they knew Bhagvan precisely as He should be known. Even Uddhavji, the wisest of the Yadavs and Bhagvan's adviser, became overwhelmed when he realised the gopis' understanding. That same Uddhavji later said, 'Bhagvan has shown great mercy to me by sending me to impart gnan to the gopis'. He had actually gone to preach to the gopis, but upon hearing their words, he himself absorbed in the preaching of the gopis.
15.7 "Though you may say that the gopis were not very intelligent, there were three distinctions amongst them: mugdha, madhya, and praudha.
15.8 "Of these, the characteristics of the mugdha gopis are as follows: They would often lecture Bhagvan and say, 'We have gone out of our way doing things for you, yet you do not take even the slightest notice of us'. Furthermore, if they were teased further, they would be upset with Bhagvan, and speak such harsh words that a person would feel they will soon fall from the path of Bhagvan. The gopis who are described in this way in the shastras, should be known as mugdha gopis.
15.9 "Those who are madhya gopis, would never become angry with Bhagvan and would never speak such harsh words. However, by using their shrewdness, they would use cunning methods to conceal their selfishness from others and do whatever they please while also doing whatever pleases Bhagvan. Therefore, they would not do only that which pleases Bhagvan. Furthermore, even if they have to do something that pleases only Bhagvan, they would definitely use a cunning method to do whatever pleases themselves as well. The gopis, who are described in this way in the shastras, should be known as madhya gopis.
15.10 "In comparison, praudha gopis would do only that which pleases Bhagvan. In no way would they use any cunning methods to satisfy their selfishness. Their only wish would be to please Bhagvan. Therefore, they remain happy with whatever pleases Bhagvan. Also, they would never become angry at, or jealous of the other gopis who are equal to them. They would also abandon vicious natures, such as man and matsar, and remain alert in the seva of Bhagvan. They would never do anything by thought, word, or deed that would displease Bhagvan. The gopis who are described in this way in the shastras, should be known as praudha gopis. In this way, there are three distinctions amongst the gopis.
15.11 "Overall, the gopis had extreme wisdom in their understanding, and therefore their love cannot be said to be without understanding. Also, they had thoroughly understood the greatness of Bhagvan. Due to the power of that understanding of Bhagvan's greatness, the qualities of atma- nishtha and vairagya naturally flourished in their hearts. Therefore, it was due to the power of understanding Bhagvan's greatness that countless kalyan-kari qualities , such as atma- nishtha and vairagya, were fully developed in the gopis.
15.12 "The characteristics of such a bhakta are as follows: He wishes for only those panch-vishays ( shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh) which are related to Bhagvan, but not for those which are related to anything else. Then, through those vishays, he develops intense love for Bhagvan. The love is so intense that even though he does not possess the qualities of atma- nishtha and vairagya, he still does not have any other desire in his heart, except the desire for Bhagvan.
15.13 "Consider the following example: When it has not rained, the seeds of any types of grass cannot be seen anywhere on the earth. But, when it does rain, so much grass grows that even the earth cannot be seen. Similarly, when a person who does not possess the qualities of atma-nishtha and vairagya meets with kusang, though he may seem to have no desire for vishays other than Bhagvan, he will begin to have desires for those objects. Furthermore, his mind will become corrupted, and he will not remember Bhagvan in his heart. Instead, he will constantly crave for the vishays. As a result, that bhakta who loves Bhagvan, but does not possess the qualities of atma- nishtha and vairagya, will feel, 'I do not have even the slightest love for Bhagvan'. Therefore, a bhakta who has love for Bhagvan, but does not possess the qualities of atma- nishtha and vairagya, is extremely inferior.
15.14 "In comparison, a bhakta whose love for Bhagvan seems ordinary, but who has the qualities of atma- nishtha and vairagya, feels, 'The murti of Bhagvan is forever present within my jeevatma'. Because of this atma-nishtha, he may not seem outwardly enthusiastic for the darshan and touch of Bhagvan's murti. In fact, he may appear to be very quiet. However, the roots of his love are very deep. Moreover, his love is not the type that would diminish due to the influence of kusang. Therefore, this bhakta is superior, and is ekantik."

Sarangpur – 16
Nar-Narayan Dev's Tap In Badrikashram
16.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Bhadarva sud 5 [12th September, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
16.2 Paramanand Swami then asked a question: "It is said in the Shreemad Bhagvat, 'While residing in Badrikashram, Nar-Narayan Rushi is performing tap for the sake of the kalyan and happiness of all the people in Bharat-Khand'. So, why is it that everyone does not walk a path of kalyan?"
16.3 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The answer lies in the fifth skandh of the Shreemad Bhagvat. It is said, 'Bhagvan is performing tap, but he does so only for the sake of his bhaktas, not for those who are not bhaktas of Bhagvan'.
16.4 "Nar-Narayan Bhagvan, who is dressed in the clothes of a tapasvi, performs harsh tap out of extreme compassion, and for the benefit of those people who realise the rarity of attaining a human body in this Bharat-Khand, and therefore attain the refuge of Bhagvan and offer bhakti to Him. While performing tap, and gifted with qualities , like dharma, gnan, vairagya, upsham, divine powers, that are constantly present in Him to a great extent, he dwells in Badrikashram until the destruction of the universe. Therefore, even if His bhaktas who live in Bharat-Khand may possess the qualities, such as dharma and gnan, to a lesser degree, they flourish greatly in just a short span of time due to the power of Bhagvan's great tap. Then, by the will of Bhagvan, these bhaktas receive the darshan of the pratyaksha murti of Shree Krishna Bhagvan amidst the divine light of Akshar- Brahm that is in their hearts. In this way, due to Bhagvan's tap, bhaktas attain kalyan without any difficulties. However, those who are not bhaktas of Bhagvan do not attain kalyan. This is the answer to your question."

Sarangpur – 17
Differences Among Muktas
17.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the evening of Bhadarva sud 6 [13th September, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting facing north on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
17.2 Then Shreeji Maharaj said, "As the vision of a person who worships Bhagvan becomes increasingly weak, he realises the unlimited nature of Bhagvan, and he increasingly realises the greatness of Bhagvan. When that bhakta identifies himself with the body, he sees Bhagvan as the witness of his jagrat, svapna, and sushupti states. Later, when he realises himself as beyond the jagrat, svapna, and sushupti states, he realises Bhagvan as beyond them too. Then, as his vision becomes increasingly weak, he realises Bhagvan as being far beyond himself and understands the greatness of Bhagvan even more. Then, as his vrutti attaches itself more and more to Bhagvan with love, his upasana of Bhagvan becomes even more firmly established.
17.3 "For example, ants, birds, men, cattle, horses, elephants, large crocodiles, and fish, all drink water from the ocean and become healthy, but the ocean's level is not even slightly reduced. Therefore, the greater the capacity of the creature, the more it understands the vastness of the ocean.
17.4 "Here is another example: A mosquito, a sparrow, a kite, a hawk, an analpakshi, and Garud all fly in the sky, yet to all of them the sky is limitless. However, the greater the strength of their wings, the more they understand the vastness of the sky and their own inferiority.
17.5 "Similarly, a bhakta whose upasana is like that of Marichi and other prajapatis, can be compared to the mosquito. A bhakta, whose upasana is higher, like that of devs such as Brahma, can be compared to the sparrow. A bhakta, whose upasana is higher still, like that of devs such as Virat- Purush, can be compared to a kite. A bhakta, whose upasana is higher still, like that of Pradhan- Purush, can be compared to a hawk. A bhakta, whose upasana is still higher, like that of pure Prakruti and Purush, can be compared to an analpakshi. A bhakta, whose upasana is even higher, like that of an Akshar mukta in Akshardham, is like Garud. As the powers of these bhaktas increase, they recognise the greatness of Bhagvan more and more. Moreover, as their own powers increase, their master-servant relationship with Bhagvan is also strengthened.
17.6 "Also, when the person engaged in worship and identified himself with the jeev, the jeev possessed the luminosity of a firefly. As he continued worshipping Bhagvan, the eight barriers ( jad prakruti) were gradually overcome, and he became increasingly luminous – first like an oil lamp, then like a torch, then like the flames of a fire, then like the flames of a forest fire, then like lightning, then like the moon, then like the sun, then like the fire of destruction, and finally, he became as radiant as the light of Akshar- Brahm.
17.7 "In this way, the luminosity, powers, and bliss of such a bhakta constantly increase. In the example, the sequence from firefly to Akshar-Brahm refers to the difference among the level of muktas. As a person reaches a higher spiritual state, Bhagvan's greatness is realised to a greater extent, and he attains a higher mukta level."
17.8 Shreeji Maharaj then bid "Jay Sachidanand" to everyone and stood up. Then, holding a branch of the tamarind tree, He stood facing east and said, "From here, the full moon appears like a small plate. But, as a person approaches it, it appears to get increasingly large. Then, when he comes extremely close to it, it becomes so vast that he is unable to see its limits. Similarly, as obstacles ( maya) are overcome and a person increasingly attains the proximity of Bhagvan, he realises the unlimited greatness of Bhagvan. As a result, his sense of servitude towards Bhagvan is increasingly strengthened."

Sarangpur – 18
Saline Land
18.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Bhadarva sud 8 [15th September, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting facing north on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jeeva Khachar's darbar in Sarangpur. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a white pagh around His head. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
18.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "If a person with shraddha comes across the company of a true sant and develops shraddha in the words of that sant, then all the kalyan-kari qualities of svadharma, vairagya, gnan, bhakti, and wisdom, would develop in his heart, and the vicious natures, such as kam, and krodh, would be burnt away. On the other hand, if he encounters kusang and develops shraddha in their words, then the qualities such as vairagya and wisdom would be destroyed.
18.3 "It is like the analogy of saline land. No matter how much rain falls upon it, no grass, or anything else, can grow upon it. However, if a flood were to sweep across the same land, then all the salt would be washed away. As a result, where there was once salt, there would now be silt. If the seeds of banyan, pipal, or other trees were to fall into that silt, they would grow into large trees. Similarly, if a person, who has the previously mentioned qualities of svadharma, vairagya, gnan, bhakti, and wisdom, firmly rooted in his heart, and who has not even the slightest desire for the pleasures of this world, were to meet with kusang, then waters ( kusang) would sweep across his heart and leave behind silt (worldly talks). Then, the seeds of vicious natures, such as kam, krodh, lobh, moh, mad, and matsar, which are dormant in the silt, would grow into large trees. Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvan should never keep kusang."
18.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj continued, "If a person has some svabhavs and he thoughtfully attempts to eradicate them by associating with a sant, then they can be destroyed. However, a person's vicious svabhavs will not eradicate if he foolishly applies any other methods. When such a fool becomes depressed, he either sleeps, cries, takes out his frustrations on someone else, or he may even do upvas. He will use any of these four methods to try to overcome his depression. If he becomes severely depressed, he may even resort to committing suicide. These are the way in which a fool attempts to overcome depression. However, such methods neither reduce the pain, nor do they eradicate a person's svabhavs. On the other hand, if a person were to attempt to eradicate them with understanding, then both the distress and the svabhav would be eradicated. Therefore, only those who have understanding become happy."
18.5 Then, Shreeji Maharaj continued with another example and said, "Large flames of a fire are extinguished when water is poured over it, whereas even a slight flash of lightning can never be extinguished, even though it is in the midst of dense rain clouds. Similarly, regardless of how much vairagya a person may have, or how much love for Bhagvan he may have, if he does not have understanding, then like the flames of the fire, all of his qualities will be lost due to water ( kusang). In comparison, a person who has the understanding of vairagya and love is like the fire of lightning. It may be slight, but it is never destroyed."
18.6 "Then, Nirvikaranand Swami asked, "Maharaj, if a person has a vicious svabhavs, like kam and krodh, can they be eradicated, or not?"
18.7 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Just as a merchant keeps an account of all his transactions, if a person keeps an account of his svabhavs from the very day he entered satsang, then they can be eradicated. He should think, 'When I was not in satsang, I had these vicious svabhavs.But, ever since I have entered satsang, they have diminished'. Then, every year, he should check to see if he has progressed or if there is still some deficiency remaining. However, a fool does not keep an account like the merchant does. Therefore, any svabhavs, which a person may have, can be eradicated if he continuously examines himself while doing satsang."
18.8 Muktanand Swami then asked, "If a person keeps kusang then it is obvious that he will develop vicious svabhavs. But, why is it that such vicious svabhavs arise even after a person associates with a sant?"
18.9 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "During his childhood, a person does not face enemies, such as kam, krodh, and lobh. Also, at that age, he also tends to have more love for Bhagvan. However, when he enters youth, the enemies increase along with the belief that he is the body. During that period, if he keeps the company of a sadhu, who does not have vicious natures and the belief that he is the body, then he will cross the ocean of youth. However, if the youth does not do this, the enemies will defeat him, and he will consequently turn vile.
18.10 "However, if an older person is spoilt while doing satsang, it is because whichever avgun he perceives in a great sant, all return to dwell in his own heart. Conversely, if he perceives the gun of a great sant and thinks, 'Any svabhavs the great sant exhibits is only for the sake of the kalyan of jeevs. In fact, He is flawless; but my identification of flaws in him is due to my own personal foolishness', and he also asks for forgiveness for his mistakes, then his deficiencies will diminish.
18.11 Mahanubhavanand Swami then asked, "Can rajasi, tamasi, and sattvik svabhavs be eradicated by doing satsang?"
18.12 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "All svabhavs can be eradicated if a person tries to eradicate them."
18.13 Mahanubhavanand Swami asked further, "If that is the case, then despite the fact that Durvasa and others have become muktas, why do they still remain tamasi?"
18.14 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The qualities, like tamo-gun, which are seen in Durvasa and others, are only present because they choose to keep them. They feel, 'If someone is misbehaving, tamo-gun is actually very necessary in order to lecture him. That is why we keep it'. Therefore, they purposely retain these qualities. Nevertheless, when a svabhav is prevalent in a person, he should have hatred towards it. He should think, 'I am a bhakta of Bhagvan, and such a vicious svabhav does not suit me'. In this way, by the grace of Bhagvan, a person's svabhavs can be eradicated if he regards them as flaws and strives to discard them."


Shree Kariyani Prakaran

Kariyani – 1
A Worm And A Bee
1.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Bhadarva sud 12 [19th September, 1820], a decorated, canopied bedstead that had been brought by Jadavji Bhakta from Surat, had been placed on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Vasta Khachar's darbar in Kariyani. A mattress with a white, silken cover had been placed upon the bedstead. A large, white, cylindrical pillow and red, silken knee-cushions had been placed on the mattress. Also, frills of gold fabric were dangling on all four sides of the bedstead. Shreeji Maharaj was sitting facing north on this beautifully decorated bedstead. He was wearing a white khes with a black border, and had tied a white feto with a gold border around His head. Also, He had covered Himself with a shelu with a gold border. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. They were all staring at the charming appearance of Shreeji Maharaj, just as chakors stare at the moon with fixed eyes.
1.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said to the paramhans, "Please begin a question-answer discussion amongst yourselves."
1.3 Bhudharanand Swami then asked, "Does nishchay in Bhagvan arise in the antah-karans or in the jeev?"
1.4 Shivanand Swami attempted to answer the question, but was unable to do so satisfactorily.
1.5 So Shreeji Maharaj said, "The jeev knows through the buddhi, which is the cause of all knowledge, and is greater than all. That buddhi resides in the man, in the chitt, in the ahankar, in the ears, in the eyes, in the nose, in the tongue, in the mouth, in the skin, in the arms, in the legs, in the genitals, and in the anus. It resides in the body in this way, pervading it from head to toe. The jeev resides within this buddhi. However, the jeev is not felt, only the buddhi is felt.
1.6 "The following example will illustrate this: When the flames of a fire rise and fall, they do so because of the wind. The rise and fall of the flames are apparent, but the wind is not apparent. Also, when dung is placed in fire, the dung begins to burn. Then, when it is placed where there is no wind, smoke begins to rise. At that time, the rising smoke is apparent, but the wind within is not apparent. Also, the clouds that move in the sky are seen to do so because of the wind, but the wind that resides within them is not apparent. In this way, flames, smoke, and the clouds represent the buddhi, and the wind represents the jeev.
1.7 "What is that jeev like? Well, the jeev is the knower of the beliefs formed by the buddhi, and it also knows Brahma, who is the cause of the beliefs in the buddhi. The jeev knows the thoughts of the man, and also knows Chandra, who is the cause of those thoughts in the man. The jeev knows the remembrance in the chitt, and also knows Vasudev, the cause of the thinking in the chitt. It knows the 'I-ness' of the ahankar, and also knows Rudra, the cause of that 'I-ness'. In this way, the jeev perceives the four antah-karans, the ten indriyas, and the vishays, and their presiding devs, who allow a person to discriminate among those vishays. The jeev does all of this simultaneously.
1.8 "That jeev appears to be in one place; it appears to be as fine as the tip of a spear; and it appears to be extremely subtle. It appears this ways because it is associated with the buddhi. But, when that jeev is known as the illuminator of the body, the indriyas, the antah-karans, the vishays, and their presiding devs, it appears to be extremely vast, and it appears to be pervasive. That is when the jeev is not associated with the buddhi.
1.9 "That jeev is not known by the indriyas, but is known by assumption. For example, on seeing a sword weighing two hundred kilograms, a person can infer, 'The carrier of this sword must be extremely strong'.Similarly, the jeev inspires the body, indriyas, the antah-karans, the vishays, and their presiding devs, simultaneously; therefore it must be  very powerful. This is how the jeev can be known by assumption." Shreeji Maharaj answered the question in this way.
1.10 Nityanand Swami then asked, "Maharaj, what is the answer to the original question in what you have just said?"
1.11 Shreeji Maharaj clarified, "Well, the answer is that when the belief of Bhagvan has developed in the buddhi, a person should realise that the belief has also developed within the jeev. How does that happen? Well, the belief initially develops in the indriyas, then in the ahankar, then in the chitt, then in the man, then in the buddhi, and then finally, it develops in the jeev." This was Shreeji Maharaj's reply.
1.12 Again, Nityanand Swami asked, "Maharaj , how can a person know when there is belief of Bhagvan in the indriyas? How can a person know when there is belief of Bhagvan in the antah-karans? How can a person know when there is belief of Bhagvan within the jeev?"
1.13 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The belief of Bhagvan which is in the indriyas should be known as follows: Of all the objects in this world which are seen, heard, smelt, or touched, some are pleasant and some are unpleasant; some give pleasure and some give misery; some are liked and some are disliked; some are appropriate and some are inappropriate. If no doubts arise even when all these characteristics are apparent in Bhagvan, that should be known to be the belief of Bhagvan in the indriyas.
1.14 "Furthermore, of the various effects of the three gun ( sattva-gun, rajo-gun, and tamo-gun), the effect of tamo-gun is laziness and sleep; the effect of rajo-gun is lust and anger; and the effect of sattva-gun is tranquillity and self-discipline. If no doubts arise even when all these are noticed in Bhagvan, then that should be known as the belief of Bhagvan in the antah-karans.
1.15 "Due to nirvikalp samadhi, Rushabh-Dev Bhagvan wandered crazily, keeping a stone in his mouth. Although his body burned in a forest fire, he remained totally unaware of it. So, if no doubts arise even when such a gunatit state is apparent in Bhagvan, then that should be known as belief of Bhagvan in the jeev.
1.16 "For example, ships that travel in the sea carry an iron anchor with them. When thrown into the sea, if that anchor is immediately retracted before it reaches the seabed, then not much effort is required; it comes out of the sea immediately. However, if it is allowed to reach the seabed before it is retracted, then it comes out only after great effort. But, if it is allowed to descend gradually, and it settles and lodges itself into the seabed, then it cannot be pulled up by any means; it cannot be retracted. Similarly, when a person develops the belief of Bhagvan in the jeev, that belief cannot be dislodged in any way whatsoever." Shreeji Maharaj spoke at length in this way, but only a small section has been mentioned here.
1.17 Then, Chaitanyanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, Bhagvan is greater than the mind and speech, and He is gunatit. So, how can the mayik indriyas and antah-karans perceive Him?"
1.18 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "When the jeev – the knower of the body, indriyas, and antah-karans – becomes merged during the sushupti state, its indriyas and antah-karans also become merged in that sushupti state. At the time, Bhagvan inspires that jeev. When the jeev enters the svapna state from the sushupti state, the dream-related locations, pleasures, vishays, and the jeev are all inspired by Bhagvan. He inspires them during the jagrat state as well. In this way, Bhagvan inspires the jeev both when it is conscious of the body, and when it is not. Also, from Pradhan, maha-tattva was formed; from maha-tattva, the three types of ahankar were formed; from that ahankar, the indriyas, devs, five maha-bhuts, and five tan- matras were formed; all these are also inspired by Bhagvan. Virat, who is composed of all these tattvas combined, is also inspired by Bhagvan. When all of these merge into Maya, Bhagvan inspires that Maya as well.
1.19 "That Bhagvan also inspires both jeev and ishvar when they identify themselves with their bodies. He inspires both jeev and ishvar even when they reside in the sushupti state, and are merged by Pradhan and are without any identify or form. He inspires Kal, which causes Maya and other entities to assume an identity and form, and also causes them to abandon their identity and form. So, how can that Bhagvan be known by the indriyas and antah-karans? Is that your question?"
1.20 Everyone confirmed, "Yes, Maharaj, that is the question."
1.21 Shreeji Maharaj continued, "The answer to that is as follows: Bhagvan does not create and sustain the world for His own sake. In fact, it is said in the Shreemad Bhagvat: buddhindriya-manah-pranan jananam-asrujat-prabhuha matratham cha bhavartham cha hyatmane kalpanaya cha" This shlok means: Bhagvan created the buddhi, indriyas, man, and prans of all people to enable the jeevs to indulge in the vishays, to take birth, to transmigrate to other loks, and to attain kalyan. Therefore, Bhagvan created this universe for the sake of the kalyan of the jeevs; Bhagvan sustains it for the sake of the kalyan of the jeevs; and Bhagvan also causes its destruction for the sake of the kalyan of the jeevs. How is that? Well, He destroys it to allow the jeevs – who are tired as a result of undergoing many births and deaths – to rest. That Bhagvan, who acts in all ways for the benefit of the jeevs, becomes like a human out of compassion. Then, when the jeevs maintain profound association with a sant of that Bhagvan, why should they not be able to know Him? They can certainly know Him."
1.22 Then, Bhajananand Swami asked, "Maharaj, why then does the Vedic shlok claim: yato vacho nivartante aprapya manasa saha" From where speech returns along with the mind without having attained Brahm and Bhagvan.
1.23 Shreeji Maharaj replied in a pleased tone, "Well, in that case, the facts are as follows: pruthvi resides in akash, but does not become like akash; jal also resides in akash, but does not become like akash; tej also resides in akash, but does not become like akash; and vayu also resides in akash, but does not become like akash. In the same way, the mind and speech do not attain Bhagvan."
1.24 Then, Nityanand Swami raised a doubt: "Maharaj, the Shrutis and Smrutis claim: niranjanaha paramam samyam-upaiti : He who is free from the blemishes of maya, attains qualities similar to those of Bhagvan. bahavo gnana-tapasa poota mad-bhava-magataha : Many who have been purified by tap in the form of gnan have attained my qualities.
1.25 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "What I just mentioned is regarding the mind and the indriyas of a vimukh. However, the mind and indriyas of bhaktas of Bhagvan do become merged with Bhagvan. For example, at the time of destruction, pruthvi, which resides in akash, becomes one with akash; jal also becomes one with akash; tej also becomes one with akash; and vayu also becomes one with akash. Similarly, the bodies, indriyas, antah-karans, and prans of those who are bhaktas of Bhagvan, due to their gnan of Bhagvan, become like Bhagvan. This is because Bhagvan's murti itself is divya. So, the bodies, indriyas, and antah-karans of those bhaktas become like Bhagvan's indriyas, antah-karans, and body. That is why the bodies, indriyas, antah-karans, and prans of those bhaktas, become divya.
1.26 "Take the following example: A bee captures a worm, stings it, and then buzzes over it. As a result, that worm – in the very same body – is transformed into a bee. Then, none of its bodily parts remain like that of a worm; it becomes exactly like a bee. Similarly, a bhakta of Bhagvan, in that very same body, becomes divya like Bhagvan."
1.27 Shreeji Maharaj then concluded by saying, "The essence of this talk that I have given is for both a person with firmness in bhakti coupled with atma- nishtha, and for a person with firmness in bhakti alone, progress is as described. However, the indriyas and antah-karans of a person with atma- nishtha only do not become divya like Bhagvan's murti; he attains only brahm-satta."
1.28 Having spoken in this way, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Now, let us stop this talk, as the sabha has become quiet. Someone please sing some pleasing kirtans." Saying this, He Himself began to perform dhyan, while the sadhu s began singing kirtans.

Kariyani – 2
A Cursed Intellect
2.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on aso sud 2 [9th October, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Vasta Khachar's darbar in Kariyani. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
2.2 By Shreeji Maharaj's agna, the junior paramhans had come to the front of the sabha and were asking and answering questions amongst themselves.
2.3 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Allow me to ask one question."
2.4 The junior paramhans responded by saying, "Maharaj, please do ask."
2.5 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "One person's intellect is such that since the day he joined satsang, he may occasionally perceive avgun in Bhagvan and His sant, but it does not persist, and then passes away. Day by day, he may continue perceiving gun and avgun, but he never abandons satsang. This is because he is wise and realises, 'There is no sant like this in the entire brahmand, and there is no other Bhagvan besides his Maharaj'. As he has realised this, he remains firm in satsang. On the other hand, another person's intellect is such that he never perceives avgun in Bhagvan or His sant. But, even though the intellects of both bhaktas are outwardly similar, and their nishchay in Bhagvan is also similar, one person continues perceiving avgun, while the other does not. What is the fault in the intellect of the person who keeps perceiving avgun? I put this question to Nana Shivanand Swami."
2.6 Nana Shivanand Swami then attempted to answer the question, but was unable to do so adequately.
2.7 Then, Bhagvadanand Swami said, "That person's intellect is cursed."
2.8 At that point, Shreeji Maharaj said, "He is correct. That is the correct answer to the question. In the world, do people not say, 'He has been cursed by someone?' In the same way, that individual has been cursed because he may have hurt a great sant, he may have hurt a humble person, or he may not have served his parents. That is why his intellect is the way it is."
2.9 Then, Bhagvadanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, how can his cursed intellect be healed?"
2.10 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "This piece of cloth which I wear on my head and a thick cloth like a rug cannot be washed with the same amount of effort. This is because this thin cloth is cleaned immediately by washing it with only a small amount of soap. On the other hand, to wash a thick cloth, it must be soaked in water for two to four days, and then boiled over a fire. Only then, after it is washed with soap, does it become clean. Similarly, if a person whose intellect is cursed follows niyams only to the extent that everyone else does, then that avgun will not be eradicated. He should not only remain free of kam, svad, lobh, moh, and man as others. Instead, he should become more free of kam than others; he should become more free of lobh than others; he should become more free of svad than others; he should become more free of moh than others. Also, he should go to sleep later than others; and he should chant the name of Bhagvan with a mala more often than others; and he should wake up a little earlier than others. In this way, if he follows niyams more intensely than others, his cursed intellect will be healed; otherwise it will not be healed."
2.11 Then, Mota Shivanand Swami asked Mota Yoganand Swami a question: "Do karma s have a form or are they formless?"
2.12 Mota Yoganand Swami replied, "I do not think I can answer that question."
2.13 Shreeji Maharaj then replied, "In reality, karma s are without a form, but the good or bad fruits which result from those karma s do have a form. Those who claim that karma s have a form are nastiks. After all, a karma is an action, and so it cannot have a form."
2.14 Shreeji Maharaj talked a great deal in this way, but only a small portion has been mentioned here.

Kariyani – 3
Shuk Muni Is A Great Sadhu - A Person Cannot Be Known By His Superficial Nature
3.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the evening of aso vad 7 [14th October, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting facing north on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Vasta Khachar's darbar in Kariyani. He was wearing a white khes and had tied a white feto around His head. He had also covered Himself with a white chadar. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
3.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "This Shuk Muni is a very great sadhu. From the day he began staying with me, his enthusiasm has been ever increasing; in fact, it has never diminished. Therefore, he is like Muktanand Swami."
3.3 Shreeji Maharaj then continued, "The affection that people develop for each other is due to gun, and the hatred they experience for each other is due to avgun. However, those gun and avgun cannot be established from a person's external behaviour. A person outwardly may walk like a cat, fixing his eyes on the floor as he walks, but on the inside, he may have intense kam. On seeing him behave in this way, a person who is not wise would think, 'He is a very great sadhu'. On the other hand, someone else may walk with wandering eyes. On seeing him, a person who is not wise would think, 'He is a fake sadhu'. However, inwardly he may be extremely free of kam. Therefore, a person cannot be judged by his external, physical behaviour. He can only be judged after staying with him. By staying with him, his activities can be observed – the way he talks, the way he walks, the way he eats, the way he drinks, the way he sleeps, the way he awakens, and the way he sits.
3.4 "Also, gun and avgun are more apparent during the period of youth, but they are not so obvious during childhood or during old age. Someone may be spoiled as a child, but as a youth he becomes honourable. Conversely, someone may be good in his childhood, but becomes spoiled during his youth. A person who is determined in that he feels, 'It is not good that I am having these improper thoughts', and who makes an effort to eradicate those thoughts, and who remains determined until they have been eradicated, progresses in satsang in his youth. On the other hand, a person who is careless instead of being alert, will not progress. So, an honourable person can be recognised from his childhood."
3.5 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj talked at length about His fondness for tyag in His childhood. He then continued, "A person who is honourable does not like the company of immature children from his childhood; he does not have an appetite for tasty food; and he continuously restrains his body. Just look, when I was a child, I had the same thoughts as Kartik Swami, and I felt, 'I want to eliminate all the parts of my mother – her flesh and blood – from my body'. So, after many spiritual activities, I malnourished my body so much that if something pierced my body, water would come out, but never blood. In this way, a person who is honourable can be known from his childhood."
3.6 Then, Bhajananand Swami asked, "Maharaj, is it better to maintain this thought in the mind, or is it better to expose the body to tap?"
3.7 To that, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The faults due to the body should be known, and the faults due to the mind should be known. Of these, which are the faults of the body? Well, repeated erections and itching of the genitals, excessive movement, rapid movement of the eyes, smelling many types of fragrances quickly, walking twenty or twenty-five miles quickly, embracing someone with such force that his bones break, ejaculating semen during dreams, and so on – all these are faults of the body, not the mind. Even if these faults of the body are greatly reduced, lustful desires, as well as desires for eating, drinking, walking, touching, smelling, hearing, and tasting, may remain. These should be known as the faults of the mind. So, the faults of the body and mind should be distinguished in this way.
3.8 "Then, the faults of the body should be removed by imposing bodily restraints. Then, once the body is weakened, the remaining faults of the mind should be eradicated by thinking, 'I am the atma, separate from desires. In fact, I am completely blissful'. A person who practices these two methods – bodily restraint and thinking of the atma – is a great sadhu. If a person has only bodily restraint, but does not think of the atma, then it is not appropriate. Conversely, if a person only thinks of the atma, but does not restrain his body, then that is also not appropriate. Therefore, a person who has both is the best. Moreover, if these two methods – self-discipline and thinking – are necessary for even grahastha satsangis to practice, then a tyagi should definitely practice them."
3.9 Then, Nishkulanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, can a person remain like that through thinking or through vairagya?"
3.10 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person remains like that due to the company of a great sadhu. Furthermore, a person who is unable to do so even with the company of a great sadhu is a great sinner."
3.11 Saying that, Shreeji Maharaj continued, "If a tyagi desires to indulge in the worldly pleasures which are appropriate only for a grahastha, then he is as good as an animal eating dry grass. This is because even though he is never going to acquire those objects, he still has a desire for them. It seems that he has not understood that fact properly; and as the saying goes, what is the point in asking the name of a village that a person is not going to visit? If he does have a craving for those objects that he has given up, will it be possible for him to obtain them during this lifetime? He can attain them only if he falls from satsang, but not while remaining in satsang. Therefore, a person who maintains a desire for those pleasures, while remaining in satsang, is a fool. This is because whoever remains in satsang is required to follow the dharma of a satsangi. For example, if a woman sets out to become a sati but turns back upon seeing the fire, would her relatives allow her to turn back? They would force her to burn on her husband's funeral pyre. Also, if a brahman lady becomes a widow but continues to dress like a married woman, will her relatives allow it? Certainly they would not. Therefore, a person who maintains indecent svabhav s while remaining in satsang has not understood this talk. If he had understood it, such indecent svabhav s would not remain."
3.12 Saying this, Shreeji Maharaj bid "Jay Swaminarayan" to everyone and departed to go to sleep.

Kariyani – 4
Awareness Of The Jeev, The Buddhi, And The Witness
4.1 In the Samvat year 1877, four-and-a-half hours after sunrise on aso vad 8 [15th October, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Vasta Khachar's darbar in Kariyani. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
4.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please begin a question-answer discussion amongst yourselves."
4.3 Gopalanand Swami asked Bhajananand Swami, "In this body, how much awareness is of the jeev, and how much awareness is of the witness ( Bhagvan)?"
4.4 Bhajananand Swami attempted to answer the question, but was unable to do so.
4.5 Shreeji Maharaj then replied, "The buddhi pervades this body from head to toe. As a result, it is simultaneously aware of the activities of all the indriyas. The jeev resides within that buddhi by pervading it. Therefore, the awareness of the buddhi is due to the awareness of the jeev. Similarly, since the witness resides within the jeev, the awareness of the jeev is due to the awareness of the witness."
4.6 Nityanand Swami then asked Shreeji Maharaj, "Maharaj, the witness does reside within the jeev. But, realising that a witness must possess a form, the question is how can that which possesses a form also be all-pervading?"
4.7 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj explained, "That which possesses a form can also be all-pervading. For example, Agni-Dev possesses a definite svarup when residing in his lok, but through his powers, he is latent within wood. Similarly, Bhagvan possesses a definite form in His Akshardham, but through His antaryami powers, He pervades the jeevs and functions as if He possesses a form. Therefore, even that antaryami form should be considered to possess a form."

Kariyani – 5
Bhagvan's Purpose For Assuming An Avatar
5.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on a so vad 14 [4th November, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a bedstead with a canopy on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Vasta Khachar's darbar in Kariyani. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
5.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I wish to ask a question."
5.3 The munis responded by saying, "Maharaj, please do ask."
5.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Bhagvan assumes an avatar on earth to grant kalyan to the jeevs. But, is He not capable of granting kalyan while remaining in His dham, without assuming an avatar? After all, Bhagvan can grant kalyan in any way He wishes. Then, what is the purpose of Him assuming an avatar on earth? Furthermore, if Bhagvan can only grant kalyan when He assumes an avatar, and He is incapable of granting kalyan in any other way, it would suggest that this is a weakness of Bhagvan. But in reality, Bhagvan is capable of granting kalyan to the jeevs by assuming an avatar, and He is also capable of granting kalyan to the jeevs without assuming an avatar. Then, what is the purpose of Bhagvan assuming an avatar on earth? That is the question."
5.5 The senior sadhu s answered according to their own understanding, but were unable to answer Shreeji Maharaj's question adequately. As Shreeji Maharaj raised doubts to their answers, their answers were all disproved. The munis then folded their hands and requested, "Maharaj, only you are capable of answering this question."
5.6 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "Bhagvan assumes an avatar for only one reason: Having surrendered Himself to the bhakti of those bhaktas who have intense love for Him, Bhagvan assumes whichever svarup the bhaktas wish for in order to grant them bliss. He then fulfils all the desires of His bhaktas. Since the bhaktas have a physical body, Bhagvan also assumes a physical body, and showers love upon those bhaktas. In addition to this, He suppresses His powers and behaves with the bhaktas as a son, or as a close companion, or as a friend, or as a relative. Because of this, the bhakta may not maintain much courtesy with Bhagvan. Nonetheless, Bhagvan showers His love upon the bhakta in whichever way He desires.
5.7 "Therefore, the only reason Bhagvan assumes an avatar is to fulfil the desires of His beloved bhaktas. Along with this, He grants kalyan to innumerable other jeevs and also establishes dharma. Now, if there is any doubt in what I have just said, please speak."
5.8 The munis replied, "Maharaj, your reply is most appropriate."

A Person Who Possesses Matsar
6.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on aso vad Amas [5th November, 1820], the day of Divali, a row of oil lamps had been arranged around a stage which had been assembled in front of the north-facing rooms of Vasta Khachar's darbar in Kariyani. Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated, canopied bedstead that had been placed on that stage. He was wearing a red surval made of kinkhab with golden embroidery. He was also wearing a black, kinkhab dagli with the words ' Nar-Narayan- Swaminarayan' imprinted upon it. Around His head He had tied an orange pagh with a border of golden threads. He had also tied a sky-blue coloured feto tightly around his waist, and garlands of yellow flowers were hanging around His neck. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
6.2 A female bhakta from the port of Deev had come on that occasion. She requested Shreeji Maharaj to allow her to perform His puja. Accepting her request, Shreeji Maharaj came down from His seat, approached the bhakta, and accepted her puja. Then, after accepting the clothes, a yellow umbrella, and a pair of wooden chakhadis offered by her, He returned to His seat.
6.3 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "For so many years bhaktas have been offering clothes and thousands of rupees worth of jewellery to me, but I have never gone of my own accord to receive them as I just did. Also, I have never become as pleased by wearing the clothes and jewellery offered by others as I have just now. I have become extremely pleased upon this bhakta today."
6.4 The munis commented, "That bhakta truly does have love." In the meantime, Dina-Nath Bhatt arrived, bowed at the feet of Shreeji Maharaj, and then sat down. Shreeji Maharaj then gave all the richly embroidered clothes to him.
6.5 Muktanand Swami then asked, "Maharaj, by which gun is Bhagvan pleased upon a bhakta?"
6.6 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Bhagvan is pleased with a bhakta who becomes free of kam, krodh, lobh, kapat, man, irshya, and matsar, and then offers bhakti to Bhagvan. But, amongst all of those, matsar is the root of all avgun. That is why in the Shreemad Bhagvat, Shree Vyasji has noted that only the sadhu who is without matsar is worthy to possess bhagvat-dharma. As a result, matsar is fainter than all the other avgun. Also, it is extremely difficult to eradicate matsar."
6.7 Then, Brahmanand Swami asked, "What is the method for eradicating matsar?"
6.8 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person who is a sadhu, and treads the path of a sadhu, will be able to eradicate matsar. However, if a person does not desire to tread the path of a sadhu, the matsar within him will never be eradicated."
6.9 Again, Muktanand Swami asked, "What causes matsar?"
6.10 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "There are three causes of matsar: women, wealth, and delicious food. But, for a person who does not have any of these three, man is the cause of matsar. Moreover, for a person who possesses matsar, the fact that I have given these clothes to Dina-Nath Bhatt, must have led to matsar. Such a person would never think, 'The person who brought such richly embroidered clothes and offered them to Maharaj should be commended. Maharaj should also be commended since He immediately gave them away to a brahman'. Such a thought would never arise in the heart of a person who possesses matsar. Even if someone else gives something and someone else receives it, a person who possesses matsar burns with envy unnecessarily."
6.11 "As for me, not even the slightest bit of kam, krodh, lobh, man, matsar, or irshya, enters my heart. Also, in my heart, I experience a strong hatred for the panch-vishays ( shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh). In fact, I do not have even the slightest interest in any one of the panch-vishays.
6.12 "Whenever I accept food or clothes, I do so on seeing the bhakti of the bhaktas; I never accept them for own physical pleasure. All of my actions, like eating, drinking, and wearing clothes, are for the sake of all the sadhu s and satsangis. If I have the feeling that it is for my own sake and not for their sake, then I would immediately discard it.
6.13 "The only reason I keep this physical body is for the sake of the satsangis; besides that, there is no other reason. Bhaktas such as Mulji Brahm - Chari and Somla Khachar, who have been staying close to me for so many years, know my nature and realise, 'Besides the bhaktas of Bhagvan, Maharaj does not have love for anything else. In fact, Maharaj is not affected by anything, just like akash'. In this way, those who constantly stay near me know my nature. I have sacrificed my body for the sake of those who are bhaktas of Bhagvan by word, thought, and deed. Therefore, in all ways, I am attached to whoever is a bhakta of Bhagvan. To me, the wealth of the fourteen loks, without the bhaktas of Bhagvan, seems as worthless as a blade of grass.
6.14 "In addition, even those who are bhaktas of Bhagvan and have firm love only for Bhagvan, will not find pleasure in the enticing vishays. Although they may sustain the body with ordinary vishays, they immediately become miserable by attractive vishays. Therefore, only such a person can be considered to be a completely perfect bhakta of Bhagvan."

Vairagya Due To Obsession - atyantik Kalyan
7.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Kartik sud 1 [6th November, 1820], a row of oil lamps had been arranged around a stage in front of the north-facing rooms of Vasta Khachar's darbar in Kariyani. Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a bedstead that had been placed on the stage. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
7.2 Then, Kashidas of the village of Bochasan asked Shreeji Maharaj a question: "Maharaj, tyagis follow the path of nivrutti; therefore, they are able to keep their vrutti constantly on Bhagvan. However, grahasthas follow the path of pravrutti; so, they are plagued with countless worldly problems. What understanding must a grahastha maintain in order to fix his vrutti constantly on Bhagvan?"
7.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The grahastha should believe, 'Just as I had parents, wives, and children during my past lives in the cycle of 8.4 million life-forms, I have the same in this life as well. In fact, there must be many mothers, sisters, and daughters from many past lives wandering around, and yet, just as I do not have any sense of 'my-ness' for them, similarly, I should not keep any sense of 'my-ness' for the relations of this body either'. Thinking in this way, if he diverts his affection from everything else, maintains firm affection only towards Bhagvan, and keeps the company of a sadhu, then even a grahastha's vrutti can remain constantly fixed on Bhagvan, just like the vrutti of a tyagi."
7.4 Hearing these words of Shreeji Maharaj, all the grahasthas present in the sabha folded their hands and asked, "Maharaj, what will become of the grahastha who is unable to behave in that way?"
7.5 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "I spoke in reference to a person who, having eradicated all desires for all objects except Bhagvan, keeps his vrutti constantly on Bhagvan. But, someone who is not so strong should abide by the dharma of satsang. He should also rely on the strength of Bhagvan and His sant, whose refuge he has taken, by believing, 'Bhagvan is adham-udharan and patit-pavan, and I have attained Him in person'. '' After hearing these words from Shreeji Maharaj, the bhaktas became extremely pleased.
7.6 Shreeji Maharaj then asked the sant, "What causes vairagya to arise?"
7.7 The sadhu s replied according to their understanding, but Shreeji Maharaj's question could not be answered adequately. So they said, "Maharaj, you will have to answer that question."
7.8 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "Upon hearing the words of the shastras and sat- purush, developing a fascination that does not diminish once developed, is the only cause for vairagya; there is no other cause. Whoever is fascinated in this way, will develop vairagya, regardless of whether he is tamasi, rajasi, or sattvik. On the other hand, if a person does not have such an fascination, he will not develop vairagya. Also, if someone's fascination diminishes after a few days, then the vairagya that develops can cause tremendous harm. How? Well, when he does have the fascination, he renounces and leaves his home. Then, after he becomes a sadhu, the fascination that he had previously developed, subsides; but the house he left behind would be in ruins. Then, like the dog of a washer-man, who is fed neither at home nor at the river, he falls from both paths. On the other hand, those who have firm vairagya, attain Akshardham."
7.9 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked another question to the paramhans, in an extremely pleased mood: "What is atyantik kalyan? Also, how does a person who has attained atyantik kalyan and siddh- dasha, feel in all of his activities?"
7.10 The munis answered according to their understanding, but Shreeji Maharaj's question was not answered adequately. So, all the munis folded their hands and said to Shreeji Maharaj, "Maharaj, you will have to answer that question."
7.11 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "During the destruction of the brahmand, the twenty-four tattvas, which have evolved from Prakruti, are absorbed into Prakruti. Then, Prakruti- Purush also disappear in the divine light of Akshar- Brahm, after which only the concentrated light, which is sachidanand, remains. The divya murti of Purushottam Bhagvan Vasudev is constantly present in that divine light. Through that divya murti, He Himself becomes visible to everyone, and incarnates on earth in human form for the purpose of granting kalyan to the jeevs. But, the jeevs on earth who are ignorant fools, claim that Bhagvan has mayik qualities within Him. In reality, he does not have any mayik qualities within Him; He is forever gunatit and has a divya murti. Moreover, it is that very same Bhagvan, who has a murti and is divya, which the Vedant shastras propound as being nirgun, achhedhya, abhedhya, and pervading everywhere. He has been described as being nirgun, in order to dismiss the mayik view from the mind of the jeev. That Bhagvan remains the same during the time of creation, sustenance, and destruction of the universe; He does not undergo any changes like worldly objects do, and He always maintains a divya svarup. Having such a firm belief of pratyaksha Purushottam, is called atyantik kalyan.
7.12 "A person who has attained siddh-dasha through such belief, experiences the following: Wherever he casts his eyes – among all the sthavar and jangam forms – he sees the murti of Bhagvan as if it is before his eyes, the same murti that constantly remains in Akshardham even after the destruction of the body, the brahmand and Prakruti- Purush. Other than that murti, he does not perceive even an atom. These are the characteristics of a person who has attained siddh-dasha."

Sagun And Nirgun
8.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Kartik sud 4 [9th November, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Vasta Khachar's darbar in Kariyani. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
8.2 Then, Muktanand Swami asked a question: "Maharaj, the Veds, the shastras, the Purans, and the historical shastras, have described the sagun svarup of Bhagvan and have also described His nirgun svarup. So, how should a person understand the nirgun svarup, and how should he understand the sagun svarup of Shree Purushottam? Also, how much does a bhakta of Bhagvan benefit by understanding the nirgun svarup of that Bhagvan, and how much does he benefit by understanding the sagun svarup of that Bhagvan?"
8.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The nirgun svarup of Bhagvan is much subtler than that which is subtle. It is the atma of all the tattvas, such as pruthvi and jal; it is the atma of Pradhan- Purush, which are higher than those tattvas; and it is the atma of pure Purush and Prakruti which are themselves higher than Pradhan- Purush; it is the atma of even Akshar who is higher than them. All these make up the sharir of Bhagvan. Just as the jeev is subtler, purer, and of greater luminosity than the body, in the same way, compared to all the other entities, Bhagvan is much more subtle, pure, unaffected, and luminous. For example, akash pervades the four bhuts ( pruthvi, jal, tej vayu). Moreover, it remains unaffected by those four bhuts, and the influences of those four bhuts do not affect akash. In fact, despite dwelling in those four bhuts, akash remains absolutely unaffected. In the same way, Purushottam Bhagvan dwells in all as their atma. Despite this, He is absolutely unchanged and untainted, and He maintains His own unique characteristics; no one is capable of becoming like Him.
8.4 "For example, even though akash dwells within the four bhuts, the four bhuts are incapable of becoming unaffected and untainted like akash. Similarly, Purushottam Bhagvan is the atma of all, yet no one up to and including Akshar is capable of becoming as powerful as Purushottam Bhagvan. In this way, being extremely subtle, extremely unaffected, extremely pure, extremely untainted, extremely luminous, and possessing tremendous, divine powers is the nirgun aspect of the murti of that Bhagvan. In another example, if Mount Girnar were to be placed next to Mount Loka-Lok it would appear extremely small. In the same way, before the vastness of Purushottam Bhagvan, countless millions of brahmands, which are encircled by the eight barriers ( jad prakruti), appear extremely small, like mere atoms. Those brahmands do not become smaller, but before the vastness of Bhagvan they appear smaller. In this way, the extreme vastness of the murti of Bhagvan is the sagun aspect of Bhagvan.
8.5 "Then, someone may doubt, 'In His nirgun svarup, Bhagvan is subtler than the extremely subtle, and in His sagun svarup, He is more vast than the extremely vast. Then, what is the nature of the original svarup of Bhagvan, who assumes both of these svarups?'
8.6 "Then, answer to that is that the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan visible in a human svarup is the eternal and original svarup of Bhagvan. His nirgun and sagun aspects are the special, divine powers of that svarup. For example, Shree Krishna Bhagvan and Arjun sat in a chariot and went to retrieve the son of the brahman. After crossing Mount Loka-Lok, they reached the darkness of Maya. Shree Krishna pierced that Maya using his sudarshan chakra. Then, reaching the light of Brahm, which is beyond that Maya, he retrieved the son of the brahman from Bhuma-Purush who resides there. In that situation, the chariot and horses were mayik and physical, but through contact with Shree Krishna Bhagvan, they became extremely subtle and chaitanya; so, they reached the nirgun Akshardham of Bhagvan. In this way, to impart subtlety to physical objects is the nirgun aspect of Shree Krishna Bhagvan's murti.
8.7 "Furthermore, that same Shree Krishna Bhagvan showed the whole brahmand, including the eight barriers ( jad prakruti) which encircle it, in his own mouth to his mother, Yashodaji. To Arjun, he also revealed the Vishvarup form in his own svarup. At the time, with the exception of Arjun, everyone saw the svarup of Bhagvan as being five-and-a-half feet in height. Also, when Bhagvan assumed the avatar of Vaman, he initially gave darshan in the form of a dwarf. However, after he had made Bali give up as much land as could be covered in three footsteps, he increased the size of his own svarup to such an extent that one footstep alone covered the seven Patals, with his own body covering the entire sky. With his second footstep, he covered the seven Svargs and pierced the outer shell of the brahmand. Bali Raja saw this vast svarup of Bhagvan, but others only saw the dwarf svarup of Bhagvan.
8.8 "In this way, Bhagvan's vastness, which is even more vast than the extremely vast, is the sagun aspect of Bhagvan's murti. For example, the sky is cloudless during the winter and summer, but when monsoon arrives, it becomes overcast with innumerable clusters of clouds. With time, these clouds form in the sky and later disperse again. In the same way, by His own will, Bhagvan reveals His divine powers from Himself in their nirgun and sagun aspects, and also withdraws them back within Himself. That Bhagvan appears to be like a human, but no one is able to understand the limits of His greatness. If a bhakta realises the nirgun and sagun aspects in Bhagvan's svarup in this way, then Kal, karma, and Maya would be incapable of binding him, and throughout the day he would continuously experience wonder in his heart."

As Stubborn As A Buffalo
9.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Kartik sud 5 [10th November, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Vasta Khachar's darbar in Kariyani. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
9.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked a question to Nityanand Swami and Brahmanand Swami: "Suppose there is someone who is so unkind and stubborn, that once he develops a grudge for someone, he never abandons that grudge. Instead, he continues to remain stubborn like a buffalo. Can such a person be called a sadhu or not?"
9.3 Both replied, "A person who is like that cannot be called a sadhu."
9.4 Then, Muktanand Swami asked a question: "Maharaj, there may be a bhakta of Bhagvan who perceives avgun in some other bhakta, and due to that, he develops hatred for that bhakta. How can he eradicate the perception of that avgun?"
9.5 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person who has the bhakti of Bhagvan in his heart and realises the greatness of Bhagvan, would never perceive avgun in a bhakta of Bhagvan, and he would never develop an unkind stubbornness towards a bhakta of Bhagvan. For example, Uddhavji had understood the greatness of Bhagvan, and therefore asked for a vardan: 'May I be reborn as any of the vines, or blades of grass, or shrubs in Vrundavan in order to have the privilege of being touched by the dust of the feet of the gopis'. Also, Shree Krishna Bhagvan told Baldevji that the trees, birds, and deer in Vrundavan are extremely fortunate. Even Brahma asked for a vardan from Shree Krishna Bhagvan: 'O Bhagvan! May I be so highly blessed to be able to serve your holy feet as your das, either in this life, or in the life of an animal or bird'.
9.6 "Therefore, a person who understands the greatness of a bhakta of Bhagvan in this way will never develop a grudge due to a person's avgun. Moreover, a person who understands such greatness never takes into account even minor avgun that are present in a bhakta of the pratyaksha svarup his own ishta-dev. In fact, a person who realises the greatness of Bhagvan looks upon even animals, trees, and shrubs, which have come into contact with Bhagvan, as equivalent to devs. If that is so, what can be said of those people who are engaged in the bhakti of Bhagvan, abiding by the vartman, and chanting the name of Bhagvan? He would certainly look upon them as equivalent to devs and would not think unkindly of them.
9.7 "Therefore, a person who understands the greatness of Bhagvan does not develop hatred towards bhaktas of Bhagvan. On the other hand, a person who does not understand such greatness does develop hatred towards them. Therefore, a person who does not realise the greatness of Bhagvan and His bhakta should be known as being half-fallen, even if he is a satsangi. Only a person who understands the greatness of Bhagvan and the bhaktas of Bhagvan should be known to be a perfect satsangi."

Checking The Pulse - A Sadhu Can Only Please Bhagvan By Performing Tap
10.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Kartik sud 10 [15th November, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in one of the east-facing rooms of Vasta Khachar's darbar in Kariyani. A sabha of ten or twelve senior sadhu s and five or six haribhaktas were sitting before Him. Shreeji Maharaj seemed to have a fever, and so he was warming Himself in front of a coal stove that had been placed before Him.
10.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj told Muktanand Swami, "Please check my pulse. It seems as if there is a slight illness in my body."
10.3 Then, after checking His pulse, Muktanand Swami said, "Maharaj! It seems to be a serious illness." Saying this, he continued, "Maharaj, it seems that the times are tough for the satsangis right now. After all, Maharaj, you are as vital to the satsangis as their lives, and any illness in your body is the very meaning of a difficult period for all satsangis."
10.4 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj said, "In order to please Bhagvan, Naradji performed severe tap by enduring cold and heat, hunger and thirst, for many yugs; and due to this, he was able to please Bhagvan. In the same way, a person who is wise deliberately performs tap by restraining his body and indriyas. Therefore, a sadhu who is wise should also behave so as to deliberately induce suffering to his body and indriyas. If that is so, why should he wish to relieve whatever suffering comes his way due to Bhagvan's wish?
10.5 "Moreover, a tyagi sadhu should firmly maintain the following wish in his mind: 'I do not desire the pleasures of the panch-vishays found in Dev-Lok, Brahm-Lok, Vaikunth, and other loks. In this very body, or by going to Badrikashram and Shvet-Dvip after I die, I wish to please Bhagvan by performing tap. Furthermore, even if it takes one life or two lives or a thousand lives, I wish to please Bhagvan only by performing tap'.
10.6 "Furthermore, the jeev's kalyan is attained only by the following understanding: 'Everything happens by the will of Shree Krishna-Narayan, not by Kal, karma, or Maya'. In this way, understanding that only Bhagvan is the all-doer, is the best cause of kalyan. Performing tap, however, earns Bhagvan's pleasure. Yet even while performing tap, a person should keep such feelings as Radhikaji and Lakshmiji keep for Bhagvan when offering loving bhakti. If a person still understands only Bhagvan to be the all-doer, then even if he does not perform tap, his jeev overcomes the misery of births and deaths. But, without performing tap, Bhagvan's pleasure is not bestowed upon that jeev.
10.7 "There is no sinner worse than the person who does not realise Bhagvan to be the all-doer. In fact, he should be known to be a sinner worse than a person who has killed a cow, killed a brahman, associated with the wife of his own guru, or criticised a sadguru who is a knower of brahm. This is because he believes Kal, karma, and Maya, to be the cause of everything; not Bhagvan. In fact, a person should not even stand in the shadow of such persons who are nastik outcasts, nor should he listen to their talks, even unknowingly.
10.8 "Furthermore, by the grace of Bhagvan, those who are bhaktas of Bhagvan may become like Brahma, Shiv, Shukji, or Narad; they may even become like Prakruti- Purush; or they may become like brahm or Akshar. However, no one is capable of becoming like Shree Purushottam- Narayan. Therefore, just like a vile person is shunned, a person should immediately shun the company of those persons and those shastras that disprove the upasana of Bhagvan and break his master-servant relationship with Bhagvan."
10.9 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, a bhakta who serves Bhagvan by offering beautiful clothes, jewellery, and various types of food, also desires to please Bhagvan. Yet, you are saying that a person can only please Bhagvan through tap. Then, what is inappropriate about pleasing Bhagvan through such offerings, without restoring to tap?"
10.10 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If the person who is offering bhakti to Bhagvan with such lavish objects does so without any desires, solely for the purpose of earning Bhagvan's pleasure, then it is all right. On the other hand, if he is tempted by those objects, viewing them to be Bhagvan's prasad, and leaving Bhagvan aside, if he develops affection for those objects, then by indulging in the vishays, he will become engrossed in them and corrupted by them – that is what is inappropriate. Therefore, a tyagi should realise Bhagvan to be the all-doer and strive to please Bhagvan only by performing tap. He should also worship Bhagvan by offering loving bhakti in the same way as Radhikaji and Lakshmiji. That is my principle."
10.11 Then, Brahmanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, please tell us how we can benefit in this lok and in the lok we attain after death?"
10.12 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The principle that I have just explained is itself the only means to attain supreme bliss, in this lok and in other loks."
10.13 Then, Gopalanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, in a person's mind, he may have great enthusiasm to develop the qualities of tyag and perform tap. But, if some obstacle is encountered in the process, what should he do?"
10.14 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person who has great dedication in any activity would never be held back, even if he were to face thousands of obstacles. That should be known to be true dedication. Just see, it has been twenty-one years since I first met Ramanand Swami. During this period, I have come across countless bhaktas who have been offering countless varieties of clothes, jewellery, food, and drink. Despite this, my mind has never been tempted by any of those objects. This is because I have dedication only for tyag.
10.15 "Furthermore, in this world there are so many widows who, following the death of their husbands, continue to grieve. On the other hand, there are also many women who renounce their wedded husbands and engage themselves in worshipping Bhagvan. Similarly, there are so many foolish men who mourn the loss of their own wives and continues to have desires for other women. However, there are so many men with vairagya, who renounce their own wedded wives and engage themselves in worshipping Bhagvan. In this way, each and every person has a different type of dedication.
10.16 "But, my dedication and principle is just this: A person should strive to please Bhagvan by performing tap. Also, realising Bhagvan to be the all-doer, he should offer bhakti to Him while maintaining a master-servant relationship, and he should not allow the upasana of that Bhagvan to be violated in any way. All of you should accept these words of mine as the most supreme principle."

The Characteristics Of Love
11.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Kartik sud 11 [16th November, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Vasta Khachar's darbar in Kariyani. He was wearing a white khes and a white dagli made of chhint. He had also tied a white pagh around His head, and was wearing garlands of yellow and red guldavadi flowers. Tassels of yellow flowers were also dangling from His pagh. In addition to this, two barbers who were holding torches, were standing before Him on either side. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
11.2 Then, Sachidanand Swami asked Shreeji Maharaj, "What are the characteristics of a person who has love of Bhagvan?"
11.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person who has love for his beloved Bhagvan, will never disobey the wishes of his beloved. That is that characteristic of love. To take an example, the gopis had love for Shree Krishna Bhagvan. So, when Shree Krishna Bhagvan prepared to leave for Mathura, all of them together decided, 'We will disobey the norms of family traditions and society, and we will keep Bhagvan here by force'. However, at the time of Shree Krishna Bhagvan's departure, they looked into his eyes and realised that it was not his wish to stay. As a result, all of them remained far away, because in their hearts, they feared, 'If we do not act according to Bhagvan's wishes, His love for us will subside'. Thinking in this way, none of them were able to utter a word.
11.4 "Then, after Bhagvan went to Mathura, even though Shree Krishna was only five miles away, the gopis never disobeyed his wishes by going for his darshan. They realised, 'If we do go to Mathura against Bhagvan's wish, then the love that Bhagvan has for us will diminish'.
11.5 "Therefore, the characteristic of love is exactly this: A person who has true love for someone acts according to that person's wishes. If he realises his beloved to be pleased by his staying nearby, then he stays nearby. On the other hand, if he realises his beloved to be pleased by his staying away, then he stays away; but in no way does he behave contrary to his beloved's wish. That is the characteristic of love. So, since the gopis had true love for Bhagvan, they did not go for Bhagvan's darshan without his agna. Only when Bhagvan sent for them in Kurukshetra did they have darshan of Bhagvan, but in no way did they disobey Bhagvan's agna. Therefore, a person who has love for Bhagvan would never disobey Bhagvan's agna. He would only act according to Bhagvan's wishes. That is the characteristic of love."
11.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Now let me ask a question."
11.7 The munis responded, "Maharaj, please do ask."
11.8 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Except for those panch-vishays which are related to Bhagvan, a bhakta of Bhagvan treats all other vishays as worthless. Therefore, he associates only with Bhagvan. Now, suppose Bhagvan were to issue the following agna to such a bhakta: 'Live away from me'. In that situation, if he keeps a selfish desire for Bhagvan's darshan, it would amount to disobeying the agna; and if he does not follow the agna, then the love that Bhagvan has towards that bhakta would not remain. Therefore, just as that bhakta has abandoned the worldly vishays ( shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh), does he also abandon the vishays related to Bhagvan, or does he not? That is the question."
11.9 Each of the munis gave an answer according to his level of intelligence, but the question was not answered satisfactorily. Then, they said to Shreeji Maharaj, "Maharaj, you will have to provide the answer."
11.10 Then, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a bhakta has deep love for Bhagvan, treats the worldly panch-vishays that are not related to Bhagvan as worthless, and if he is firmly attached to Bhagvan via the panch-vishays, then wherever such a bhakta goes by Bhagvan's agna, the murti of Bhagvan also goes with him. Moreover, just as that bhakta cannot remain without Bhagvan, in exactly the same way, Bhagvan also cannot remain without the bhakta. In fact, He does not leave the heart of the bhakta even for a fraction of a second. Therefore, such a bhakta does constantly maintain contact with Bhagvan in the panch- vishays. This is because the same panch-vishays that no one can stay without, that bhakta has considered to be worthless. Instead, he has attached himself to Bhagvan in the panch- vishays. Therefore, that bhakta maintains a constant relationship with Bhagvan."

Kariyani – 12
Destroying The Karan Body
12.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Kartik sud Punam [20th November, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Vasta Khachar's darbar in Kariyani. He was wearing a white khes and a white dagli made of chhint. He has also tied a white feto with a bokani around His head. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
12.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please begin a question-answer discussion."
12.3 Then, the munis asked questions amongst themselves for quite some time, where the topic of the three bodies of the jeev ( sthul, sukshma, and karan) and the three bodies of ishvar ( virat, sutratma and avyakrut) arose.
12.4 Shreeji Maharaj then commented, "The karan body is the maya of the jeev. That same karan body evolves into the sthul and sukshma bodies. Therefore, all three bodies – sthul, sukshma, and karan – can be said to be the maya of the jeev. In the same way, virat, sutratma, and avyakrut can be said to be the maya of ishvar.
12.5 "The karan body, the maya of the jeev, is attached so strongly to the jeev that they cannot be separated by any means whatsoever. However, if a person attains the company of a sant, realises the svarup of Bhagvan through the words of that sant, performs dhyan on the svarup of Bhagvan, and takes in the words of Bhagvan in his heart, then the karan body attached to his jeev is burnt completely.
12.6 "For example, the shell of a tamarind seed is firmly attached to the seed. But, when the seed is roasted over a fire, the shell is burnt and then becomes detached. It can then be peeled off easily by rubbing the seed in your hands. Similarly, when the karan body is 'roasted' by performing dhyan and following the words of Bhagvan, it becomes separated from the jeev just as easily as when a person rubs off the shell of a roasted tamarind seed. However, even if a person were to try a million other methods, he would not be able to destroy the jeev's ignorance in the form of the karan body."
12.7 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked a question to the munis: "During the jagrat state, sattva-gun prevails and a person has knowledge of all objects. In spite of this, when a person hears something in the jagrat state, it can only be strengthened if he thinks of it in the sukshma body. However rajo-gun prevails in the sukshma body; and during the state of rajo-gun, complete knowledge is not possible. However, in the sukshma body, when a person thinks about what he has heard during the jagrat state, it becomes complete knowledge. How can this apparent contradiction be resolved?"
12.8 The munis collectively attempted to explain to the best of their understanding, but none could provide an adequate answer to Shreeji Maharaj's question. Therefore, they folded their hands and said, "Maharaj, this question can only be answered by you."
12.9 Shreeji Maharaj thereupon explained, "The answer is that the jeev, which is the kshetragna, dwells within the heart. The kshetragna enlightens the fourteen indriyas. Of these indriyas, the antah-karans dwell extremely close to the kshetragna. As a result, whatever a person hears is consolidated when he thinks about it in the antah-karans. After all, the kshetragna is more powerful than all the indriyas and the antah-karans, and so whatever it approves becomes thoroughly strengthened."
12.10 Having heard this answer, the munis commented, "Maharaj, you have given a precise answer. No one besides you could have answered that question."
12.11 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Regardless of how lustful, angry, greedy, or rude a person may be, if he listens to these types of talks with faith and love, all of his vicious natures would be eradicated. For example, if a man with teeth strong enough to chew raw chick-peas were to eat many sour mangoes, he then would not be able to chew even boiled rice. In that same way, if a person, who is strongly overpowered by vicious natures were to listen to these talks with shraddha, then that person would no longer be capable of indulging in the panch- vishays. Moreover, the mind does not become as free of desires for vishays by subjecting the body to strict vrats such as tapta- kruchhra, chandrayan, as it does by listening to these talks of Bhagvan. In addition, your minds must not become stable while performing dhyan or by turning a mala as perfectly as they do while you are listening to these talks. Therefore, a person should listen to the talks of Purushottam- Narayan with faith and love. There is no better method to stabilise the mind and to free it of the desires for vishays."


Shree Loya Prakaran

Loya – 1
Anger - Developing Complete Satsang
1.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Kartik vad 10 [30th November, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in the residential hall of the paramhans in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was wearing a white, cotton-padded surval and a white dagli made of chhint. He had also tied a white feto around His head. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
1.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked the munis, "What does 'Shankar' mean?"
1.3 The munis replied, "That which gives bliss is called Shankar."
1.4 Hearing this answer, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Last night, an hour or two before sunrise, Shivji granted me his darshan in a dream. He was seated on the big, powerful Nandishvar. His body was of a large build, and he had thick, matted hair; he appeared to be approximately forty years of age. Along with Shivji was Parvati, who was wearing all white clothes. Shivji, like a great sadhu, appeared tranquil, and he showed great love towards me. However, I did not feel love for him. This is because I believe, 'Shiv is a dev that is full of tamo-gun, whereas I worship Shree Krishna-Narayan who is the incarnation of tranquillity'. Therefore, I do not have much love for devs like Brahma, Shiv, and Indra, who have rajo-gun and tamo-gun. Moreover, I have much hatred towards anger; I do not like angry men or angry devs. Nonetheless, why do I respect Shivji? I do so because he is a tyagi, a yogi, and a great bhakta of Bhagvan.
1.5 "What is anger like? Well, it is like a rabid dog. If the saliva of a rabid dog touches a man or an animal, then they suffer and die, just like the constantly barking rabid dog. Similarly, a person infected by saliva in the form of anger, suffers like a rabid dog, and falls from the path of a sadhu.
1.6 "Furthermore, just like a butcher, an Arab, a cruel soldier, a tiger, a leopard, and a black snake frighten everyone and kill some, similarly, anger frightens all and takes the life of some. If such anger arises in a sadhu, it appears very unsuitable; after all, a sadhu should be calm. But, if anger were to arise, that sadhu would appear cruel to others. At that time, the sadhu's appearance would change since anger itself is ugly. Therefore, anger makes a person appear ugly."
1.7 Then, Shuk Muni asked, "Maharaj, if a slight trace of anger arises but is then suppressed, is such anger disruptive, or not?"
1.8 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a snake were to appear in this sabha at this moment, then even if it does not bite anyone, everyone would still have to rise and scatter; there would be panic in everyone's heart. Furthermore, if a tiger were to come and roar at the outskirts of the village, then even if it does not harm anyone, all would feel terror within, and no one would come out of their homes. Similarly, even if a trace of anger were to arise, it would still be a source of extreme misery."
1.9 Then, Nana Nirmananand Swami asked, "By what means can kam be totally uprooted?"
1.10 To this, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Kam is uprooted if a person has extremely firmly realised himself to be the atma; and he firmly follows the panch-vartman, including the vow of the eight types of brahm-charya; and he thoroughly understands the greatness of Bhagvan. However, even after the roots of kam have been eradicated, a person should not deviate from brahm-charya and other niyams in any ways. However, the method for totally uprooting even the most vicious form of kam is to fully understand the greatness of Bhagvan."
1.11 Then, Bhajananand Swami asked, "Maharaj, what are the characteristics of the three levels of vairagya – kanishth, madhyam, and uttam?"
1.12 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person with the kanishth vairagya is pure while strictly following the niyams related to the tyag of women as described in the Dharma-Shastras. But, if he were to see a women's body, then his would get attached to that body, and he would not remain stable. Such a person can be considered to be a person with the kanishth vairagya.
1.13 "If a person with a madhyam vairagya were to see a naked women, no disturbance would arise in his mind, just as he would not be disturbed by seeing naked animals. Moreover, his mind would not become attached to that woman. Such a person can be considered to be a person with the madhyam vairagya.
1.14 "Now, if a person with the uttam vairagya were to come across women and other worldly objects, even in solitude, he would not be tempted. Such a person can be considered to be a person with the uttam vairagya."
1.15 Then, Bhajananand Swami asked again, "What are the characteristics for the three levels of Bhagvan's gnan – kanishth, madhyam, and uttam?"
1.16 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person with the kanishth gnan initially develops the nishchay in Bhagvan upon seeing His powers. However, when such powers are not seen in Him, or when nothing unpleasant happens to an evil person who slanders Bhagvan, then his nishchay would not remain. Such a person can be described to be a person with the kanishth gnan.
1.17 "If a person with a madhyam gnan were to see pure and impure human actions of Bhagvan, he would be deceived by them, and his nishchay in Bhagvan would not remain. Such a person can be described to be a person with the madhyam gnan.
1.18 "A person with the uttam gnan, would not be deceived even after seeing any type of pure or impure actions performed by Bhagvan, and his nishchay would not diminish. Moreover, even if the person who initially convinced him of Bhagvan were to say, 'He is not Bhagvan', he would feel, 'This person must be mad'. Such a person can be described to be a person with the uttam gnan.
1.19 "Of these, the person with the kanishth gnan becomes siddh after countless lives; the person with a madhyam gnan becomes siddh after two or three lives; and the person with the uttam gnan becomes siddh in the same life." Shreeji Maharaj replied in this way.
1.20 Then, Mota Shivanand Swami asked, "Despite having complete nishchay in Bhagvan, why does a person not feel fulfilled within?"
1.21 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person whose antah-karans burns due to enemies, such as of kam, krodh, lobh, svad, sneh, and man, would not believe himself to be fulfilled – even if he does have nishchay in Bhagvan."
1.22 Then, Nityanand Swami asked, "What is the method for overcoming these enemies?"
1.23 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The enemies are overcome only if a person remains alert to harshly punish them. Just as Dharma- Raj remains ready, day and night, to beat sinners with a stick, similarly, if the indriyas behave immorally, then the indriyas should be punished; and if the antah-karans behave immorally, then the antah-karans should be punished. The indriyas should be punished by imposing upon them the kruchhra chandrayan and other vrats, and the antah-karans should be punished through a thought process. As a result, those enemies, like kam and krodh, would be defeated. Then, by having nishchay in Bhagvan, a person would feel himself to be completely fulfilled."
1.24 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "Who can be said to have developed complete satsang?"
1.25 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "First of all, such a person has extremely firmly realised himself to be the atma. Also, he believes his atma to be absolutely detached from the body, the indriyas, and the antah-karans; he does not believe the actions of the body and indriyas to be his own. Despite this, he does not permit even a slight lapse in following the panch-vartman. Moreover, even though he himself behaves as brahm-svarup, he does not abandon his feeling of servitude towards Purushottam Bhagvan; he faithfully worships Bhagvan while maintaining a master-servant relationship with Him. Furthermore, he realises the pratyaksha murti of Bhagvan to be absolutely unaffected, like akash.
1.26 "That akash is interwoven with and pervades the other four bhuts; and the actions of the other four bhuts occur within akash. Similarly, despite performing pure and impure actions, the pratyaksha Shree Krishna- Narayan remains unaffected, just like akash. Also, such a person realises the countless powers of this Bhagvan as follows: 'This Bhagvan appears to be human for the kalyan of the jeevs. But, in fact, He is the creator, preserver, and destroyer of countless brahmands. He is the lord of Golok, Vaikunth, Shvet-Dvip, Brahmpur, and other dhams. He is also the lord of all the countless akshar-rup muktas'. With this understanding of Bhagvan's greatness, he devoutly engages in various forms of bhakti, and in listening to the talks of Bhagvan. He also serves Bhagvan's bhaktas. When a person behaves in this way, his satsang can be said to be complete."
1.27 Nana Shivanand Swami then asked, "At times, a person understands the greatness of a bhakta of Bhagvan extremely well, but at other times, he does not understand it so well. What is the reason for this?"
1.28 Then, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A sant follows the path of dharma. When he sees a person treading the path of adharma, he lectures that person. As a result, a person who identifies himself with the body will not know how to accept the advice positively and, in return, will perceive avgun in the sant, and will have hatred towards the sant. Therefore, a person understands the greatness of a sant as long as he is not lectured by him. Even when that person is given beneficial advice that may pain him, he perceives avgun in the sant, and does not retain that understanding of the sant's greatness.
1.29 "A person who perceives avgun in a sant, is unable to become pure by any form of prayshchit. In fact, release from the sins, such as lust, is possible, but release from the sin of insulting a sant is not possible. For example, if a person contracts tuberculosis, no medicine would be able to cure the disease; he would definitely die. Similarly, a person who perceives avgun in a sant should be known as having tuberculosis; he will certainly fall from satsang sometime in the future. Furthermore, even if a person's hands, feet, nose, eyes, fingers, and other body parts are severed, he still cannot be described as dead. However, when the head is severed from the body, he is described as dead. Similarly, a person who perceives avgun in a bhakta of Bhagvan, has had his head severed. If he lapses in following other vartman, then his limbs can be said to be severed – he will still live. That is, he will survive in satsang. But, a person who has perceived avgun in a sant will certainly, at some time, fall from satsang. He should be known to have had his head severed."
1.30 Then, Bhagvadanand Swami asked, "If a person has perceived avgun in a bhakta, is there any method to apologise for it, or not?"
1.31 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "There is a solution, but it is extremely difficult; a person who has intense shraddha can do it. When avgun are perceived in a sant, a person should think, 'I have committed a great sin by perceiving avgun in a brahm-svarup bhakta of Bhagvan'. From such thoughts, he will feel intense regret in his heart. As a result of such regret, while eating, he will be unable to distinguish between tasty and tasteless food, and at night he will be unable to sleep. As long as the avgun of the sant is not removed from the person's heart, he will continue to experience extreme guilt, just like a fish will suffer without water.
1.32 "On the other hand, when he intensely perceives gun in that sant, then if that sant has been hurt in any way, he would please him with absolute humbleness. If this type of thought remains in a person's heart, then even if he has perceived avgun in that sant, they would still be overcome, and he would not fall from satsang. Apart from that, there is no other solution; this is the only solution."

Faith, Gnan, Courage, Or Love
2.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Kartik vad 11 [1st December, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting facing south on a decorated bedstead in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was wearing a red, kinkhab surval and a black, kinkhab dagli with the word ' Nar-Narayan' imprinted upon it. Around His head, he had tied a sky-blue coloured feto with golden threads along the edges, from a town called Buranpur. He had also tied an orange feto around His waist. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Muktanand Swami and other paramhans were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a dukad, saroda, satar, and manjira.
2.2 After the singing had concluded, Shreeji Maharaj said, "O paramhans, please listen. I wish to ask you a question."
2.3 The munis said, "Maharaj, please ask."
2.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "In this satsang, when does a bhakta become free from the fear of death and become convinced of his own kalyan in this very life?"
2.5 Muktanand Swami replied as best as he could, but was unable to give a precise answer to Shreeji Maharaj's question. So, the other paramhans requested, "Maharaj, you will have to answer that question."
2.6 Shreeji Maharaj then began, "While you were singing kirtans, I thought about this. In my mind, I feel that there are four types of bhaktas of Bhagvan who no longer fear death and who feel completely fulfilled. These four types are: first, a person who has faith; second, a person with gnan; third, a person with courage; and fourth, a person with love. These four types of bhaktas do not fear death, and they feel fulfilled while still alive.
2.7 "I shall now describe the characteristics of these four types of bhaktas. A bhakta who has faith, has established absolute faith in the words of Bhagvan and His sant. Therefore, by the strength of his faith in Bhagvan, he does not fear death. Also, he believes, 'I have attained the pratyaksha Purushottam Bhagvan, and therefore I am fulfilled'.
2.8 "A bhakta with gnan, has the strength of atma- gnan, and believes, 'I am brahm-svarup and a bhakta of Bhagvan'. Therefore, he too does not fear death.
2.9 "All the indriyas and antah-karans tremble with fear before a bhakta who has courage. Also, he is not afraid of anyone. So, he does not disobey any of Bhagvan's agna in any way. As a result, he believes himself to be fulfilled and does not have even the slightest fear of death.
2.10 "The fourth, who has love, has the nature of a pati-vrata wife. The vrutti of a pati-vrata wife is not drawn to anyone except her own husband, and she has love only for her husband. Similarly, this bhakta of Bhagvan, like a pati-vrata, has love only for his master, Bhagvan. As a result, he believes himself to be fulfilled and does not have even the slightest fear of death.
2.11 "Out of these four types of characteristics, even if only one is predominant and the other three are minor, a person still overcomes the fear of births and deaths. But if a person does not have any one of the four, then his fear of death is not overcome."
2.12 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj asked all the paramhans and other bhaktas, "Of these four, please declare which characteristic is predominant within you." So, all the paramhans and bhaktas described whichever characteristic was predominant within them. Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj was very pleased.
2.13 Then, Shreeji Maharaj continued, "Of these four types, all those who have the characteristic of courage may come near and bow down at my feet." Those who had the characteristic of courage, placed Shreeji Maharaj's holy feet on their chests and bowed down before Him.
2.14 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Those who wish to ask a question, please ask."
2.15 Brahmanand Swami then asked, "That which is the cause should be greater than its effect. Why, then does a large tree arise from the small seed of a banyan tree?"
2.16 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A cause may be small and subtle, yet it is still capable of producing a vast effect – that is the very greatness of the cause. For example, the entities evolved from Mul- Prakruti – the countless Pradhans – occupy an immense region, whereas the cause – Mul- Prakruti – has the svarup of a female. In the same way, smell, which is the cause of pruthvi, is subtle, whereas the entity evolved from it, pruthvi, is large. Similarly, akash and the other four bhuts occupy a vast area, but their causes, such as sound and touch, are subtle. Therefore, the cause may be small, but it still has the ability to produce a vast effect; this is its capability.
2.17 "For example, Agni-Dev possesses a svarup like that of a man; and his size is like that of a man; but his effect (flames of fire) is large. Similarly, the svarup of Varun-Dev is the size of a man, but his effect (water) is very abundant. Also, the svarup of Surya is seated in a chariot like a man, but his effect – light – pervades the entire brahmand. In the same way, the cause of all, Shree Purushottam- Narayan is the size of a man, yet He is the cause of countless millions of brahmands. But, a person who is a fool thinks, 'If the effect is this big, then the cause must be so much bigger!' Actually, this is the understanding of a fool.
2.18 "Bhagvan, who is the cause of all, appears like a human being; yet by His extraordinary powers, He is able to create countless millions of brahmands from His body and is able to absorb them back into Himself. For example, Agni, Varun, and Surya appear vast in the form of their effects, but they withdraw their effect back within themselves, and only they remain. In the same way, within each and every hair of Bhagvan, countless brahmands, each composed of the eight barriers ( jad prakruti) and fourteen loks appear as mere atoms. In this way, the cause is magnificent and full of greatness. So, a person who is wise realises, 'Bhagvan appears like a human, but, in fact, He is the cause of all and the creator of all; He is all-powerful'."
2.19 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj returned to go to sleep.

Loya – 3
Nishchay In Bhagvan And The Knowledge Of His Greatness
3.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Kartik vad 13 [3rd December, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was wearing a white dagli made of chhint and a white, cotton-padded surval. He had also tied a white feto around His head, and covered Himself with a white pachhedi. A sabha of munis, as well as satsangis from various places, had gathered before Him.
3.2 Then, Bhagvadanand Swami and Shivanand Swami asked Shreeji Maharaj, "What are the characteristics of a person who has nishchay in Bhagvan and His sant coupled with the knowledge of their greatness?"
3.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "What would a person who has nishchay in Bhagvan and His sant coupled with the knowledge of their greatness not do for the sake of Bhagvan and His sant? For them, he would leave his family, give up any fear of public ridicule, give up a kingdom, give up pleasures, give up wealth, leave his wife, and in the case of a woman, she would leave her husband."
3.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj narrated the stories of the following bhaktas: Rajput Galuji of the village Dadusar; Kushal-Kunvar-Bai of Dharmapur; Parvat-Bhai; Rajbai; Jeevu-Ba; Ladu-Ba; Mota Rambai; Dada Khachar; Mancha Bhakta; Mulji Brahm - Chari; Ladhi-Bai and Mataji of Bhuj; Muktanand Swami; Samat Patel, an ahir from the Valak region; Mulji and Krishnaji of the village Mankuva; the two Kathi bhatkas of the village Gundali in the Valak region; and other satsangis. Maharaj described in detail whatever they had done for the sake of Bhagvan and His sant.
3.5 Then, He added, "A person who has nishchay in Bhagvan coupled with knowledge of His greatness, never disobeys the words of Bhagvan; he does as Bhagvan says." Having said this, He asked, "What was my nature like? Well, I was such a tyagi that I could stay in one place as long as the time interval between the morning and evening milking of cows, not any longer. I had intense vairagya. Moreover, I had deep love for Ramanand Swami. Therefore, when Swami sent a message from the city of Bhuj via Mayaram Bhatt, saying, 'If you desire to stay in satsang, you will have to stay by embracing its pillar'. I literally embraced a pillar. Seeing this, Mayaram Bhatt said, 'You should live according to Muktanand Swami for nine months. So, a person who has the previously mentioned nishchay in Bhagvan and His sant can also be known by this characteristic." Shreeji Maharaj then narrated the stories of Sundarji Suthar and Dosa Vaniya.
3.6 After mentioning that a person who has such nishchay in Bhagvan and His sant has constant enthusiasm, Shreeji Maharaj narrated the story of Rana Rajgar.
3.7 Next, Shreeji Maharaj narrated the story of Prahlad: "Prahlad said to Nrusinhji, 'Maharaj, I am not afraid of this terrifying svarup of yours. Moreover, I do not consider your protection of me as true protection. Instead, when you save me from my enemy's army (the indriyas), I shall consider that to be true protection'. Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvan would not be overjoyed if Bhagvan were to protect him physically; and he would not be disappointed if he were not protected. Instead, he would remain carefree and continue to worship Bhagvan.
3.8 "Moreover, he would intensely understand the greatness of Bhagvan and His sant." Then, Shreeji Maharaj narrated the story of the old lady from the village Kathlal.
3.9 Continuing, He said, "Even if such a bhakta – with nishchay in Bhagvan and His sant coupled with the knowledge of their greatness – were to die painfully; or if a tiger were to devour him; or if a snake were to bite him; or if a weapon were to strike him; or if he were to drown in water; or if he were to die in any other horrific way; he would still believe, 'A bhakta of Bhagvan never suffers from an unpleasant outcome; he will certainly attain the dham of Bhagvan. On the other hand, even if a vimukh were to die naturally and were to be cremated in a funeral pyre with sandalwood and the full funeral rites, he will certainly go to Yampuri'. He would understand the difference between the two extremely clearly.
3.10 "So, a person who develops such firm belief in his heart should be known as having nishchay in Bhagvan and His sant coupled with the knowledge of their greatness. A person with such nishchay will definitely reach Brahm-Mahol; he would not reside in any other lower dham."

A Person With Doubts
4.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Kartik vad 14 [4th December, 1820], three hours after sunrise, Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was wearing a white surval and a white dagli made of chhint. He had also tied a white pagh around His head. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
4.2 Then, Akhandanand Swami asked Shreeji Maharaj, "There are countless millions of brahmands. In those brahmands, does the murti of Bhagvan appear the same as the murti in this brahmand at this present time, or not?"
4.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Bhagvan always resides in His Akshardham. From the countless Pradhan- Purush pairs that evolve from Mul- Maya, countless millions of brahmands evolve. Then, for the sake of His bhaktas, while still residing at one location in His Akshardham, and by His own wish, that Bhagvan appears in countless svarups in the countless millions of brahmands."
4.4 Again, Akhandanand Swami asked, "Shree Krishna- Narayan always has a human svarup, and the svarup of Bhagvan is forever satya. However, that same Bhagvan appears sometimes as Matsya, Kurma, Varah, Nrusinh, and other countless svarups. How should this be understood? Furthermore, is the method of kalyan and the murti of Bhagvan in each brahmand the same, or different?"
4.5 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The murti of Bhagvan is always the same. Even then, by His own wish, Bhagvan shows His murti wherever and in whatever murti is required. He also reveals His powers to whatever extent is appropriate in various places. He always has two arms, but by His wish, at times He appears with four arms, or eight arms, or even countless arms. He also appears in svarups like Matsya and Kurma. In this way, He incarnates in whichever svarup is appropriate for the place. However, He always resides in His dham in one svarup.
4.6 "Furthermore, while remaining in one location, He pervades the countless millions of brahmands through His antaryami svarup. For example, Vyasji was one, but when he called out to Shukji, he did so by residing in all the sthavar and jangam beings. When Shukji replied, he did so in the same way. In this way, even great yogis like Shukji are capable of pervading the entire world. Such people have attained such extraordinary powers as rewards of worshipping Bhagvan. But, Purushottam Bhagvan, who is called Yogeshvar, is the master of all extraordinary powers. So, while still remaining in one location, what is surprising about Him incarnating, by His own wish, wherever and however is appropriate? What is so surprising about Bhagvan possessing such abilities? People become astonished even when a magician displays simple illusions, and they cannot fully comprehend the magic. But, Bhagvan possesses all extraordinary powers and is the greatest source of wonder. So, how can the jeev know Him?
4.7 "The Shreemad Bhagvat mentions, 'This many have overcome Bhagvan's maya'. However, it also mentions, 'No one has overcome the force of Bhagvan's maya'. Here, a person should realise that if even those like Brahma were to doubt Bhagvan's extraordinary powers, then they cannot be said to have overcome the power of Bhagvan's maya. What is this doubt? It is the thought, 'Why does Bhagvan behave like that?' On the other hand, a person who understands 'Bhagvan is extremely powerful; so whatever He does is appropriate', is said to have overcome maya.
4.8 "In reality, the method for kalyan is the same; but because there are three levels in the people who worship ( uttam, madhyam, kanishth), and because there are countless levels in their shraddha, there are many differences in the path of kalyan taken by people. However, in reality, there is only one path of kalyan. After all, there is only one svarup of Bhagvan. This Bhagvan is extremely powerful and no one, including Akshar, is capable of becoming like Him. This is an established principle."
4.9 Then, Muktanand Swami said to Shreeji Maharaj, "Today, Jhina-Bhai has become very upset, and he said that since Maharaj did not come to my house, what is the point of me staying in that house?"
4.10 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj said, "When a person loves by force and with unhappiness, that love does not survive for very long. Also, the bhakti and love of a person who is unhappy, is ultimately abolished. Therefore, it is a great mistake to wear a sad face due to displeasure."
4.11 Jhina-Bhai then said, "When Bhagvan and His sant come to a person's house, his face should glow with delight; but when they do not come, his face should definitely reflect disappointment and he should feel sorrow in his heart."
4.12 Hearing this remark, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A person should be pleased when Bhagvan and His sadhu s come, but he should never grieve. If his nature is to grieve, then ultimately, something misfortunate is bound to occur. Therefore, while following his own dharma, a person should happily follow Bhagvan's agna, but he should never become upset in order to get his own way. If Bhagvan issues an agna to go somewhere and the person becomes disturbed out of grief, then the darshan and prasad previously given by Bhagvan, the countless types of talks relating to gnan, and all other actions by which he had felt happiness, are all lost. Furthermore, due to the disturbance, only tamo-gun spreads throughout the mind. Therefore, he goes where he is asked to go in a state of pure misery. Then, as a result of the distress, he cannot carry out the agna completely. Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvan should remain ever joyful and should worship Bhagvan with a cheerful mind. Moreover, however unpleasant his circumstances may be, he should not allow even the slightest trace of depression to enter his heart."

Controlling The Indriyas And The Antah- Karans
5.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Kartik vad Amas [5th December, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was wearing a white surval and a white dagli made of chhint. He had also tied a white pagh around His head. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
5.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked all the paramhans, "By revealing which thoughts can a person be considered to be honest, and by not revealing which thoughts can a person be considered to be deceitful?"
5.3 As the paramhans were unable to answer, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Any weakness in following the panch-vartman, which cannot be overcome by a thought process, should be revealed before a sant who has no such weaknesses. If a person has perceived avgun in a sant, that should also be revealed. Furthermore, any doubts in his nishchay in Bhagvan should also be revealed. Only then can he be considered to be honest. If any of these internal thoughts have arisen, and they are not revealed before a sant, then such a person should be known to be deceitful."
5.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked another question: "If a person is deceitful, and also cunning, how can he be recognised?"
5.5 Again, the paramhans were unable to answer.
5.6 So, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "His deceitfulness can be recognised by keeping his company; and while staying with him, by observing him while he eats, drinks, sits, stands, walks, and talks. Also, when separated from him, if another person is asked to secretly observe him, then his deceitfulness would be recognised."
5.7 Shreeji Maharaj then posed another question: "Suppose there is a person who follows the vartman and keeps nishchay in Bhagvan out of pretence. He is intelligent and arrogant, and he shows his nishchay and his observance of the vartman to be more superior than the genuine vartman and nishchay of others. So, how can a person's false nishchay and observance of vartman be recognised?"
5.8 Once again, the paramhans were unable to answer the question.
5.9 So, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "His pretence can be recognised when his reputation is insulted. Otherwise, it cannot be recognised."
5.10 Again, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Which thought causes a person to deflect from his nishchay in Bhagvan and observance of vartman? Which type of thought would not cause a person to deflect from them? Also, if there is a time span, for what duration must these thoughts remain in order to deflect a person from his dharma and his nishchay in Bhagvan?"
5.11 Again, the paramhans were unable to answer.
5.12 So, Shreeji Maharaj said, "If a person attempts to eradicate an improper thought related to dharma, but the thought still remains; or, if such a thought does not arise for fifteen days or for a month, but arises someday suddenly – then such a thought would cause him to fall from dharma. The same applies to a person's nishchay in Bhagvan. However, any thought which is eradicated by applying a thought process once it arises, and which does not arise again, would not cause a person to fall from his dharma or his nishchay."
5.13 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Whose foundation in satsang becomes solid, and whose does not?"
5.14 Once again, the paramhans could not answer.
5.15 So, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Dattatrey perceived the gun of the five maha-bhuts, the moon, various animals, a prostitute, a virgin, his own body, and many others. Similarly, if a person has the nature of perceiving the gun of a sadhu, his foundation in satsang will become solid. If a person does not have such a nature then even though he remains in satsang, his foundation is not firm."
5.16 Again, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Can the indriyas and the antah-karans in a person be completely controlled by the company of the sant, by reading the shastras, and by applying his own thought process? Or can they be controlled if only one of these three is present? If you say that all three must be present, then what methods should be learnt from a sant, what methods should be learnt from the shastras, and how would a person apply his own thought process? Please explain this."
5.17 Again, the paramhans were unable to answer.
5.18 Then, Shreeji Maharaj explained, "From the shastras, a person should realise the greatness of Bhagvan and His sant. From the sant, a person should learn methods for controlling the indriyas. For example, a person's vision should be kept fixed on the nose in this way, and he should not listen to worldly talks. These and other methods should be learnt from a sant. By his own thought process, a person should look positively upon the methods taught by the sant, as being for his own kalyan. Then, he should behave accordingly. In this way, the indriyas and antah-karans can be overcome by these three methods."
5.19 Then, Shreeji Maharaj posed another question, "Are the antah-karans controlled by controlling the indriyas, or are the indriyas controlled by controlling the antah-karans?"
5.20 Since the paramhans could not answer the question, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a person controls the physical indriyas by physical tap, and then even after the physical indriyas have been controlled, if he still firmly follows the niyams of the panch-vartman, then the antah-karans can be controlled by controlling the physical indriyas. So, the physical indriyas cannot be controlled by controlling the antah-karans alone. However, the antah-karans can be controlled by controlling the physical indriyas. How is that? Well, if a person controls the physical indriyas and does not let them indulge in the vishays, then the antah-karans within would become frustrated and would think, 'This type of enjoyment is not going to be possible in this life'. ''
5.21 After this, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "By what method are the physical indriyas controlled and by what method are the antah-karans controlled?"
5.22 Again, since the paramhans could not answer, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The physical indriyas can be controlled by following the niyams specified for a tyagi in the Dharma-Shastras; by controlling the diet; by following vrat like tapta- kruchhra and chandrayan; by deliberately tolerating cold, heat, hunger, and thirst; by engaging in the katha, talks, and kirtans of Bhagvan; by engaging in bhajan and smaran; by controlling the posture; and by many other spiritual activities. The antah-karans of a person can be controlled by thinking of Bhagvan's greatness, by performing dhyan upon Bhagvan, and by realising himself to be the atma."

Purifying The Company A Person Keeps - The Difficulties Of Becoming An Ekantik Bhakta
6.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Magshar sud 1 [6th December, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was wearing a white khes and a white dagli made of chhint. He had also tied a white feto around His head and had tied a bokani with another feto. The chhoglu of the white feto was hanging from His head. In addition to this, He had covered Himself with a chadar. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
6.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked the paramhans, "After joining satsang, what do you consider to be the most difficult achievement?"
6.3 The paramhans could not answer the question, so Shreeji Maharaj replied, "For a person to become ekantik is extremely difficult. What is this state of being ekantik? Well, it is to do bhakti of Bhagvan along with dharma, gnan, and vairagya. That is the state of being ekantik."
6.4 Again, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Which one activity related to dharma is such that if it is practiced, all aspects of dharma remain? Moreover, out of bhajan, smaran, singing or listening to kirtans, listening to talks, and other spiritual activities, which one activity, if it is kept even when all others are abandoned in difficult times, helps maintain all of the others?"
6.5 Shreeji Maharaj answered His own question: "Of the activities related to dharma, if a person maintains the vow of nishkam, all other activities will develop. Of the spiritual activities, if a person keeps nishchay in Bhagvan, then all of the others will develop."
6.6 Again, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Which type of thinking, if maintained constantly, is beneficial; and if altered, is destructive? Also, which type of thinking is beneficial if repeatedly altered, and destructive if not altered?"
6.7 Again, Shreeji Maharaj answered His own question: "Thoughts regarding a person's nishchay in Bhagvan should never be altered. It is beneficial if they are repeatedly reinforced by listening to the greatness of Bhagvan. Conversely, repeatedly altering them would be destructive. However, if a person has firmly decided in his own mind, 'I want to do this', then that type of thinking should be repeatedly altered on the advice of a sadhu. If the sadhu suggests, 'You should not sit here and should not do this', then a person should not sit there and should not do that. If his own decision is altered, it would be beneficial; if it is not altered and he does as he pleases, then that would be destructive."
6.8 Again, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "By sitting with and listening to which type of satsangi or paramhans would make him subject to developing faults, despite the fact that he follows dharma?"
6.9 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a person has nishchay in Bhagvan and follows dharma, but also believes himself to be the body and has pride as well as desires for worldly activities, then if Bhagvan and His sant criticise these, he will definitely perceive avgun in Bhagvan and His sant. Then, he will talk about the perceived avgun of Bhagvan and His sant to others, and cause them to become like a vimukh. A bhakta should not associate with such a person in any way; doing so is harmful."
6.10 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Which type of sadhu, even though he follows dharma and has nishchay in Bhagvan, should a person not accompany to bathe, sleep near, or hear talks from?"
6.11 Shreeji Maharaj answered His own question: "A sadhu who discouragingly says, 'Can the vow of nishkam and other qualities really be attained in one life? They are attained only by the grace of Bhagvan; otherwise kalyan is attained after countless lives. So, can kalyan truly be attained in this very life?' A person should shun the company of anyone who speaks such discouraging words. Conversely, someone else claims, 'We are fulfilled in this very life. The force of kam, krodh, mad, matsar, man, and other vicious natures is small. By the grace of Bhagvan and His sant, we will destroy them all'. A person should, by all means, seek the company of a sadhu who speaks in this way and is eagerly engaged in methods to destroy the vicious natures."
6.12 Again, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Which type of sadhu, even if he speaks encouragingly, should be shunned?"
6.13 Shreeji Maharaj answered His own question: "If a sadhu emphasises his own efforts only and believes himself to be fulfilled by his own efforts, but does not acknowledge the strength of Bhagvan and does not feel, 'By acting in this way, I want to please Bhagvan', then such a sadhu should be shunned."
6.14 Again, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Which type of sadhu should a person keep the company of, and which type should a person not keep the company of?"
6.15 Shreeji Maharaj then replied, "If we are staying with a sadhu who follows the vartman strictly and has firm nishchay in Bhagvan, but instead of lecturing us, he pampers us and lets us have our way, then even if he is considered great in public opinion, like Muktanand Swami, his company should not be kept. On the other hand, if a sadhu repeatedly lectures a person, and maintains constant awareness on any svabhav he sees within him; and if he does not stop criticising that svabhav until it is overcome, and does not compliment him, then even if he is not considered great in public view, a person should still keep his company."
6.16 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked another question: "Suppose a sadhu possesses all the glorious qualities like bhakti and gnan. However, due to which one vicious flaw, should a person avoid his company?"
6.17 Again, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If he is very lazy, sleeps too much, and when told by others to bathe, perform dhyan, or to follow other niyams, says, 'I'll do it later, what's the hurry? I'll do them slowly', then even though he may appear to be good, a person should avoid his company."
6.18 Shreeji Maharaj asked another question: "A sadhu may speak well; but, due to which fault in his speech should his talks not be heard?"
6.19 Shreeji Maharaj then replied, "Out of arrogance, if he talks about the bhakti, gnan, vairagya, and dharma within himself to be superior; and shows the gun of bhakti, gnan, vairagya, and dharma in other sadhu s to be inferior, then a person should not listen to his talks."
6.20 Once again, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Which type of speech should be viewed as amrut even though it is harsh?"
6.21 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The words of a sadhu who in his speech criticises his own parents, sister, brother, and varna, and ashram with harsh words, should be known to be good. This is because a person who hears those words realises the qualities of that sadhu, and thinks: 'In no way does this sadhu have attachment to his bodily relations'. Therefore, those words should be enjoyed like amrut."
6.22 Shreeji Maharaj posed another question, "When should a person maintain pride, and when should a person not maintain pride?"
6.23 Shreeji Maharaj answered once again: "A person should not maintain pride before a devoted follower of Bhagvan, even though he may be a simple and humble haribhakta. On the other hand, a person should certainly maintain pride before a person who has fallen back from satsang. In fact, a person should not become suppressed by him; and in any question-answer exchange, his words should be answered with harsh words."
6.24 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "When should a person have a desire for the darshan of Bhagvan and His sant? When should he not have such a desire?"
6.25 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Suppose I were to ask all the sadhu s, 'Who will go to Buranpur and Kashi?' Then, when no one speaks, someone should rise in the sabha and say to me, 'Maharaj, if you say so, I shall go'. So saying, he should follow my agna and go there. In those situations, to gain my happiness, a person should not keep any desire for keeping the company of sant or my darshan.
6.26 "Moreover, when a person – who a sadhu or I have criticised, lectured, insulted, or expelled, and who is crying out of shock – is approached by an ekadmal vimukh who starts to talk about the avgun of the sadhu or me, then before him, the person should reveal tremendous love towards the sadhu and Bhagvan. He should say, 'I am his servant, and even if he were to cut me to pieces, I still would never perceive avgun in him. He will grant me kalyan'. In that situation, he should reveal great love."
6.27 Again, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "What should not be done, even if Bhagvan is pleased by it? What should be done, even if Bhagvan is displeased by it?"
6.28 Shreeji Maharaj answered His own questions: "If I were to give an order which seems to be full of adharma, then a person should be hesitant in following it; he should take some time and not accept it immediately. For example, Shree Krishna Bhagvan ordered Arjun, 'Cut off Ashvatthama's head'. But, Arjun did not follow that agna. Likewise, even if I am pleased by it, that type of instruction should not be followed. Also, an instruction by which the prescribed niyams of the panch-vartman are disobeyed should not be followed. If by not obeying these two types of agna, Bhagvan is displeased, then a person should definitely let Him be displeased; in those cases, a person should not attempt to please Him."
6.29 Shreeji Maharaj asked again, "While performing dhyan upon Bhagvan, countless different waves of vicious thoughts arises in the mind, just as large waves arise in the ocean. When such thoughts do arise, how can they be suppressed?"
6.30 Shreeji Maharaj answered His own question: "When such vicious thoughts arise, a person should stop the dhyan, and should clap and chant 'Swaminarayan, Swaminarayan' loudly, without shame. He should pray to Bhagvan, 'O lord! You are a friend of the humble! You are an ocean of mercy!' Also, he should remember a great sadhu of Bhagvan, like Muktanand Swami, and pray to him too. As a result of this, all disturbing thoughts will be eradicated, and peace will prevail. Apart from this, there is no other method to eradicate such thoughts."
6.31 Then, Shreeji Maharaj posed another question: "Which quality should be abandoned, even if it is believed to be a great quality in this satsang and is being praised by all? Which fault, even though it is a fault, is suitable to be absorbed?"
6.32 Once again, Shreeji Maharaj supplied the answer Himself: "A person may be like Muktanand Swami and may be following the vartman strictly than all. However, as a result of this, if another sadhu feels inferior because he cannot behave on the same level, then that quality, even though it may be great, should be abandoned. Instead, he should behave on the same level as all the other sadhu s. Even though behaving on the same level as others is a drawback, it should be done."
6.33 Again Shreeji Maharaj asked, "In these sadhu s, which is the one flaw which, when abandoned, would cause all flaws to be abandoned? Which is the one quality which, if developed, would cause all qualities to be developed?"
6.34 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "All flaws in a person reside in the flaw of perceiving himself with the body. If that is abandoned, all flaws are abandoned. Furthermore, if the sole quality of atma- nishtha (realising himself as the atma, and distinct from the body) is developed, then all qualities will develop."
6.35 Shreeji Maharaj again asked, "Which types of panch- vishays, when indulged in, enlighten the mind, and which types of vishays, when indulged in, cause ignorance to prevail in the mind?"
6.36 Again, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "By indulging in vishays related to Bhagvan, the mind is enlightened; and by indulging in worldly vishays, ignorance prevails in the mind."
6.37 Next, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Which desh, which kal, which sang, and which kriya should a person not associate with, even if it is Bhagvan's agna?"
6.38 Shreeji Maharaj again supplied the answer Himself: "Even if it is Bhagvan's agna, a sadhu should not stay in a place where he has frequent contact with his bodily relations. Also, if I seat him where women can also be seen while having darshan, and if I were to say, 'Do my darshan', then he should not sit in that place. Instead, he should make an excuse and leave. In addition, if unpleasant kal is prevailing and riots are taking place, then even if it is Bhagvan's agna to stay, a person should leave that place; but he should not stay there and suffer beatings."
6.39 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked another question: "Which shastras should be heard and studied, and which shastras should not be heard or studied?"
6.40 Once again, Shreeji Maharaj answered Himself, "Shastras which do not promote Bhagvan possessing a svarup and do not describe Bhagvan's avatars, but instead discuss pure Vedant and propose a single, formless entity, should never be studied or heard; even if they have been written by someone very intelligent. On the other hand, simple kirtans, like those composed by Ranchhod Bhakta, should be sung and heard if they describe Bhagvan's murti. Such shastras should only be studied and heard."

The Indriyas, The Antah-Karans, And Experience
7.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Magshar sud 3 [7th December, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was wearing a white pagh, with the chhoglu hanging on one side. He was wearing a white dagli made of chhint and a white, cotton-padded surval. He had also covered Himself with a white pachhedi. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
7.2 In the sabha, Nityanand Swami brought the Vachanamrut manuscript and presented it to Shreeji Maharaj. Shreeji Maharaj examined the manuscript and was extremely pleased by it. He then said to the paramhans, "Today, please ask complex questions so that we may have a discussion."
7.3 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "The Shrutis state: rute gnana-na muktihi : There is no kalyan without gnan. tameva viditvati-mrutyumeti nanyaha pantha vidyate-yanaya : Only by knowing Him does a person go beyond death; there is no other path for attaining kalyan. "These shloks state that the jeev attains kalyan only when it realises the true gnan of Bhagvan. If kalyan can only be attained by gnan, why do the shastras also prescribe other spiritual activities for attaining kalyan?"
7.4 Hearing this question, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Gnan means 'to know'."
7.5 At this point, Nityanand Swami raised a doubt. He said, "If gnan means merely 'to know', then the whole world knows Bhagvan through the shastras. However, not everyone attains kalyan."
7.6 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj raised a question, "Just as a person does not attain kalyan by knowing the previous avatars of Bhagvan through the shastras, do you think all those who actually had the darshan of Ram, Krishna, and other avatars of Bhagvan with their own eyes attained kalyan?"
7.7 Muktanand Swami replied, "Those who merely see the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan only attain kalyan after several lives."
7.8 Shreeji Maharaj added, "Those who know Bhagvan through the shastras also receive kalyan after several lives. This is because the Bhagvan that these people know through the shastras is the same Bhagvan other people see with their eyes; and the Bhagvan that other people see with their eyes is the same Bhagvan that people know through the shastras. Therefore, the resulting rewards of both are equal, and both attain kalyan after several lives.
7.9 "After all, is not hearing Bhagvan with the ears, gnan? It is, but that can be said to be merely hearing Bhagvan. Is not touching Bhagvan with the skin, also gnan? It is, but that can be said to be merely touching Bhagvan. Is not seeing Bhagvan with the eyes, gnan? It is, but that can be said to be merely seeing Bhagvan. Is not smelling Bhagvan with the nose, gnan? It is, but that is merely smelling Bhagvan. Does not describing Bhagvan with the tongue also constitute gnan? It does, but that is merely having described Bhagvan. In this way, gnan can be attained through the physical indriyas. It can also be attained through the antah-karans, as well as directly from the experienced gnan of the jeev, which is greater than both the indriyas and the antah-karans. Of these, which gnan are you speaking of?
7.10 "In order to create the universe, Bhagvan assumed the svarup of Aniruddha; and within Aniruddha dwells the sthavar and jangam world, along with akash. In the svarup of Sankarshan, Bhagvan destroys the universe. In the svarup of Pradyumna, He sustains the universe. He also assumes various avatars, such as Matsya and Kurma. He assumes these svarup according to whichever task needs to be accomplished in whichever place. Some of these tasks are invisible to the indriyas and antah-karans, and can only be known by experience. For the successful completion of these tasks, Bhagvan assumes a suitable svarup. On the other hand, some of these tasks are visible to the indriyas and antah-karans. For the successful completion of these tasks, again Bhagvan assumes an appropriate svarup. Therefore, the gnan of which of Bhagvan's svarup is instrumental in attaining kalyan? Is that your question?"
7.11 Nityanand Swami confirmed, "We are saying that kalyan is attained by the gnan of Bhagvan whose svarup can be realised by the indriyas, the antah-karans, and experience."
7.12 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "That Bhagvan is Shree Krishna. He has said of himself: yasmat-ksharama-teetohama-ksharadapi chottamaha : I am greater than all this is perishable, and I am greater than the imperishable. vishtabhyaham-idam krutsnam-ekanshena sthito jagat : I sustain the entire universe with a single fragment of myself.mattaha parataram nanyat-kinchid-asti dhanamjaya mayi sarvam-idam protam sutre manigana iva : O conqueror of wealth (Arjun). There is nothing at all that is greater than me. All this creation is strung upon me – like a series of gems on a thread. pashya me parth rupani shatasho-tha sahasra-shaha nana-vidhyani divyani nana-varna-kruteeni cha : O Son of Prutha (Arjun)! Behold my hundreds and thousands of divya svarups that are of various types and of assorted colours and shapes.
7.13 "In these and many other shloks, He describes Himself as invisible to the indriyas and the antah-karans. Therefore, knowing Bhagvan perfectly means knowing pratyaksha Bhagvan through the indriyas, the antah-karans, and experience. Only then can a person be said to possess perfect gnan. However, if any one of these three types of gnan is lacking, a person cannot be said to have realised atyantik gnan, nor can he overcome the cycle of births and deaths. In fact, even though someone may have attained the brahm-svarup state through his personal activities, if he does not realise pratyaksha Bhagvan in this way, he cannot be said to possess perfect gnan. That is why it is said in the Shreemad Bhagvat: naishkarmyama-pyachuta-bhava-varjitam na shobhate gnan-malam niranjanam : Even pure gnan, in which all karmas have been rejected, is not elegant if it does not have bhakti towards Bhagvan.
7.14 "The Geeta also states: karmano haypi boddhavyam boddhavyam cha vikarmanaha akarmanash-cha boddhavyam gahana karmano gatihi : The nature of karma should be understood, the nature of prohibited karmas should be understood, and the nature of non-karma should also be understood. Indeed, the way of karma is very complex. "Even in the state of non- karma ( gnan), there is still something left to be realised. That is to say, even after a person has become brahm-rup, he still has to realise Parbrahm Purushottam. Only a person who is brahm-rup has the right to offer bhakti to Purushottam.
7.15 "Now, what constitutes bhakti? It is when a person becomes brahm-rup and performs the bhakti of pratyaksha Bhagvan with sandalwood paste, flowers, shravan, and manan – just as the niranna- muktas of Shvet-Dvip, having become brahm-rup, perform puja of Parbrahm Narayan by offering various types of offerings, such as sandalwood paste and flowers. Therefore, Bhagvan has mentioned in the Geeta: brahma-bhootaha prasannatma na shochati na kankshati samaha sarveshu bhooteshu mad-bhaktim labhate param : A person who has become brahm-rup remains joyful, grieves nothing, desires nothing, behaves equally with all beings, and attains my supreme bhakti.
7.16 "Therefore, a person who does not offer bhakti to Parbrahm after becoming brahm-rup, cannot be said to have attained atyantik kalyan. bhoomir-aponalo vayuhu kham mano buddhir-eva cha ahankara iteeyam me bhinna prakruti-rashtadha : These are my eight forms of prakruti – pruthvi, jal, tej, vayu, akash, man, buddhi, and ahankar." This describes the all-pervaded jad prakruti.
7.17 "Furthermore, apareyam-itas-tvanyam prakrutim viddhi me param jeeva-bhootam mahabaho yayedam dharyate jagat : But O mighty-armed Arjun! Also, know my other prakruti, the very element of life (chaitanya), by which this world is upheld. Such is the all-pervasive chaitanya prakruti." This describes the all-pervasive chaitanya prakruti.
7.18 "That pratyaksha Bhagvan is such that He is the supporter of both the eight forms of jad prakruti and also of the chaitanya prakruti that pervades within. For example, akash is the supporter of the other four elements – pruthvi, jal, vayu, and tej. Whenever pruthvi contracts, akash contracts along with it. When the pruthvi expands, akash also expands along with it. Similarly, akash also contracts and expands along with the contraction and expansion of jal, tej, and vayu. However, pruthvi and the other tattvas all contract and expand within akash. In the same way, Bhagvan expands and contracts along with the expansion and contraction of the two prakrutis, while they themselves contract and expand within Bhagvan Himself. That Bhagvan is the atma of all. This fact is stated in the Shrutis: antah-pravishtaha shasta jananam sarvatma : Bhagvan, who enters within all, is the controller and atma of all beings yasyaksharam shareeram esha sarva-bhootantaratma-pahata-papma divyo, deva eko narayanaha : He, whose sharir is the imperishable, is the indwelling atma of all beings, is without all evil, and is the one divya Bhagvan Narayan. yasyatma shareeram ya atmanam-antaro yamayati sa ta atmantaryam-yamrutaha : He, whose sharir is the atmas, and who governs all atmas from within, is your atma, the antaryami, and immortal. yasya pruthivi shareeram yaha pruthiveem-antaro yamayati sa ta atmantaryam-yamrutaha : He, whose sharir is pruthvi and who governs it from within, is your atma, the antaryami, and is immortal.
7.19 "Furthermore, even food, the mind, knowledge, and bliss have been described as brahm; various such types of brahm-vidya have been mentioned. What is the significance of this? Well, those things have been called brahm because Bhagvan is the cause of all and the supporter of all. However, they are all the sharir, and their shariri is pratyaksha Shree Krishna Purushottam. Both the jad and chaitanya prakrutis, along with their entities that have evolved in their expanded and contracted states, dwell easily within Bhagvan. Moreover, Bhagvan dwells within them all as their antaryami and as their cause. It is that very Bhagvan who is pratyaksha. To know and see Bhagvan with such an understanding of greatness is called perfect gnan."
7.20 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "If a person cannot experience the greatness of Bhagvan in this way, but does have a firm belief of it in his antah-karans, then can that be said to be perfect gnan, or not?"
7.21 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "In a dark house, a person can faintly see the grain-store and the pillars; but due to the darkness, they cannot be said to have been seen totally. In the same way, both the jad and chaitanya prakrutis reside within Purushottam Bhagvan, and He dwells within them as well. But, if a person experiences this only by assumption and does not actually see it, then he cannot be said to possess perfect gnan. Nevertheless, because he has such a firm nishchay, he surely must have experienced some sort of alokik powers of Bhagvan in the past; if not, he will experience them in the future.
7.22 "Despite having such a doubtless nishchay, if he does not experience the alokik powers, he should think, 'Bhagvan possesses all those powers, but He does not reveal them to me because that is His wish'. If a person offers bhakti to Bhagvan with such understanding and remains fulfilled, then he can also be said to possess perfect gnan.
7.23 "Therefore, a bhakta with gnan is a person who thoroughly knows Bhagvan through the indriyas, the antah-karans, and experience. Such a bhakta has been praised in the Geeta as the best of all bhaktas: arto jignasur-artharthee gnanee cha bharatar-shabha tesham gnanee nitya-yukta eka-bhaktir-vishishyate : O supreme among the descendants of Bharat (Arjun). Four types of people worship me: a person who is distressed, a person who seeks knowledge of the atma, a person who desires material objects, and a person who has gnan. Of these, the one with gnan is the best because he is always engaged in me and is devoted to me alone.
7.24 "A bhakta with gnan, faithfully serves pratyaksha Bhagvan – who eternally has a svarup – realising Him as greater than Prakruti, Purush and Akshar, and as being the cause and supporter of all. This understanding constitutes gnan; and such gnan leads to atyantik moksh. Those who do not understand this, merely claim 'aham-brahmasmi' – I am brahm – from the shastras. They proclaim, 'I am the svarup of brahm, and Ram and Krishna are merely avatars originating from me'. Such blasphemous and unorthodox vedantis of today are extremely evil and great sinners. At death, they are sent to Narak, and they will never be released from there."

Loya – 8
Hyperactive Indriyas
8.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Magshar sud 5 [10th December, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was wearing a white khes and had tied a white feto around His head. He was also wearing a white dagli made of chhint. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
8.2 Then, Muktanand Swami asked Shreeji Maharaj, "On seeing some inappropriate svabhav of a sadhu, a person who is thoughtless may perceive avgun in the sadhu. But, why does a person who is wise perceive avgun in the sadhu?"
8.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a person is wise and has noticed an inappropriate svabhav within himself, has a hatred towards it, and is continually acting to overcome that svabhav, then when he sees that very same svabhav in another sadhu, he develops a dislike towards that sadhu. On the other hand, a fool does not overcome his own svabhav s, and when he sees that same svabhav in another sadhu, he perceives avgun in that sadhu. Such a person should be considered a fool."
8.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj gathered the junior paramhans, and He Himself asked and answered questions.
8.5 First, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "The intensity and mildness of the force of kam, krodh, lobh, and other enemies is due to the phases of childhood, youth, and old age. In childhood the force is weak; in youth, the force in intense; then in old age the force becomes weak again. Therefore, the intensity and mildness of the inner enemies can be noticed; but can they be weakened by any thought process?"
8.6 Shreeji Maharaj Himself replied, "The force of the enemies can be weakened by a thought process, which is as follows: The mildness of those svabhav s in childhood, their greater intensity in youth, the mildness once again in old age, is due to food. Specifically, in childhood, since the dietary intake is small, the force of kam is mild. Similarly, in old age, a person dietary intake is small, so again the force of kam is mild. But in youth, as the dietary intake increases, kam also increases. Therefore, in youth, if a person's food intake is decreased, and if he deliberately tolerates cold, heat, rain, and hunger, then by maintaining such a thought process, and by maintaining profound association with a great sant, the force of kam is weakened – even in the period of youth."
8.7 Again, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "People become addicted to many different types of substances, like bhang, cannabis, opium, and alcohol. Are these addictions due to a person's kriyaman or prarabdha karma s?"
8.8 Replying, Shreeji Maharaj said, "These addictions are developed not by prarabdha, but by habit. Therefore, if a person maintains courage, keeps shraddha, and is determined to defeat the addiction, then it can be overcome. But, if he has no shraddha and is cowardly, then that addiction cannot be overcome."
8.9 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Some children have a mature nature like elder people, whereas some have an extremely fidgety nature. Is that nature due to company, or is it inherent within the jeev?"
8.10 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "For the most part, a good or bad nature is due to the company kept by a person; but in some cases, it is due to past karma s."
8.11 Then, Kapileshvaranand Swami asked, "Maharaj, how can a person recognise a svabhav which has formed in a past life, and how can he recognise a svabhav which has formed in this life?"
8.12 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A recently formed svabhav is overcome by staying in the company of a devout sadhu and by making a little effort to eradicate it. Just as grass growing on a wall dries up when there is no rain for five days, similarly, a recently formed svabhav can be overcome in a few days. However, a svabhav that has remained for a long time is difficult to overcome, even after great effort is made to eradicate it. For example, if there are strong weeds or a bordi tree in the soil, then even if they are set on fire and burnt by a farmer, they will still grow. However, if a person uses a hoe to uproot them from their roots, they can be removed. Similarly, if a person remains in the company of a devout sadhu and persists with great effort, even an established svabhav can be overcome; but only with great effort."
8.13 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "For a person whose indriyas are hyperactive, what are the individual methods by which that hyperactivity can be overcome?"
8.14 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "To overcome the hyperactivity of the eyes, a person should fix his gaze on the tip of his and nose and not look elsewhere. While studying, he should also engage in bhajan and smaran. While doing this, if he continues to keep his eyes open without blinking for half an hour or so – until his eyes begin to burn intensely and tears flow – and he does not hold a improper thought even if he happens to notice a woman or other objects, then even if his eyes are hyperactive, they will become controlled.
8.15 "The nose does not like the odours coming from someone's body, mouth, or clothes. At that time, a person should think, 'My own body appears attractive superficially, but it is filled with blood, flesh, and bones; and in the abdomen there are faeces, urine, and the intestines'. If he thinks in this way, the hyperactivity of the nose is eradicated.
8.16 "The hyperactivity of the ears can be eradicated as follows: When a person hears some humorous talks or gossip, he develops a keen interest to listen to them; whereas, while listening to the kathas and kirtans related to Bhagvan, he falls asleep. In that situation, a person should rise and suppress sleep and laziness. He should also keep faith in and maintain a keen interest in listening to the kathas of Bhagvan. The ears can be controlled in this way.
8.17 "The sense of touch can be controlled by deliberately tolerating the cold, heat, and rain; by lying down anywhere; by keeping a blanket as a pillow and using it for covering the body only when it is very cold. Therefore, the skin becomes numb, and the hyperactivity of the sense of touch is eradicated.
8.18 "To overcome the hyperactivity of the hands, a person should keep a mala in his hand whenever the hands are idle, and turn it while chanting the name of Bhagvan in rhythm with the inhaling and exhaling of his breath. However, he should not turn the mala hurriedly. Some say, 'A person can chant the name of Bhagvan more quickly mentally'. That principle is wrong, as the mind can only chant the name of Bhagvan as many times as the tongue can chant the name of Bhagvan. So, by applying this method, the hyperactivity of the hands is eradicated.
8.19 "If the legs are hyperactive, they can be controlled by controlling the sitting posture.
8.20 "Hyperactive genitals can be controlled as follows: When a person gets scabies or ringworm, and he scratches himself, the itching is not relieved until bleeding occurs. However, if he does not scratch the affected area, then the itching decreases by itself. Therefore, even if an itching sensation arises on the genitals, it should not be scratched. Moreover, in the case of it becoming frequently excited, if a person decreases his diet, does upvas, and physically weakens the body, then the genitals can be controlled.
8.21 "To conquer the tongue, it should not be given items that it likes, and the diet should be restricted. In this way, the hyperactivity of the tongue is eradicated.
8.22 "Finally, the hyperactivity of a person's speech can be eradicated by not interrupting with wise remarks when people like Muktanand Swami are speaking or narrating from the shastras. Moreover, if a person does happen to interrupt, he should turn a mala twenty-five times. By this method, the hyperactivity of speech can be eradicated."
8.23 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Of all these indriyas, which one, if fully controlled, leads to control over all the other indriyas?"
8.24 Shreeji Maharaj answered His own question, "If the tongue is fully suppressed, then all the other indriyas can be suppressed."
8.25 Again, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "If kam pervades a person's heart, and even though his genitals are covered by his clothes, how can a person realise that he has been pervaded by kam?"
8.26 Shreeji Maharaj Himself replied, "When kam pervades a person, his eyes, and all of his other indriyas become hyperactive. In this way, a person can realise that he has become overwhelmed by kam."
8.27 Once again, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "A person who has a hyperactive nature should become calm, and a person who has a calm nature should become active. By which thought process can this be achieved?"
8.28 Shreeji Maharaj Himself replied, "If a person who is hyperactive thinks, 'I am the atma, brahm, genderless, and stable like akash', and he attains the upsham state through such thoughts, then he becomes calm. If a person who is calm wishes to become more active, then he should realise the greatness of Bhagvan and His bhaktas. When he realises the greatness of Bhagvan, he engages in the nine forms of bhakti, and performs basic service of the bhaktas of Bhagvan. As a result of this, his nature becomes more active."
8.29 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Is there anything in the eight shastras, such as the Shreemad Bhagvat, which should be ignored, or should everything be remembered?"
8.30 Replying to His own question, Shreeji Maharaj said, "In all of those shastras there are countless charitras, and through all of those charitras, the strengths of the bhaktas who have attained Bhagvan are described. Therefore, they are all suitable to be remembered. However, among all these charitras, only those charitras that match a person's own strengths should be remembered. The others may be ignored with the following understanding: 'These talks are true, but they are for the benefit of other bhaktas; they are not for me'. ''
8.31 Once more, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "All of you youngsters are seated here; and from amongst you, all the sadhu s praise some and do not praise others. Now, all of you are of a similar age and all have the same company. In fact, you all have the same food, clothing, upasana, shastras, and mantra, and all listen to the same talks. So, what is the reason for the difference in levels amongst you? Moreover, he who is a sadhu, follows dharma completely, is unbiased, and views all equally; therefore, he would describe everyone as they truly are. So, please answer the question."
8.32 Again, Shreeji Maharaj provided the answer, "Only he who has shraddha is praised by a sadhu; and that is also why he follows dharma more strictly. Also, he has shraddha in serving a sant, and in listening to the talks of Bhagvan. He also has faith in the sant. Therefore, he has progressed. On the other hand, he who has not progressed, despite staying in such company, should be known to lack shraddha."

Loya – 9
Development Of Dharma, Gnan, Vairagya, And Bhakti
9.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Magshar sud 6 [11th December, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was wearing a white dagli made of chhint, and a white surval. He had also tied a white feto around His head. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
9.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj requested, "May all the paramhans please engage in a question-answer discussion amongst themselves."
9.3 atmanand Swami then asked Akhandanand Swami, "What are the factors that lead to the development of vairagya, gnan, bhakti, and dharma?"
9.4 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "Vairagya is developed when a person comes to understand the nature of Kal. What is this nature of Kal? Well, it is to know the process of nitya- pralay, nimit- pralay, prakrut- pralay, and atyantik- pralay, as well as the lifespan of all beings from Brahma to the smallest blade of grass. After knowing this, if a person understands the body, the brahmand, and all other objects to be subject to the force of Kal, then vairagya would arise.
9.5 "Gnan arises if a person listens to the Upanishads, such as the Bruhadaranya Upanishad, Chhandogya Upanishad, and Kathvalli Upanishad, the Bhagvad Geeta, the Vasudev Mahatmya, the Vyas Sutras, and other shastras from a sat- purush.
9.6 "Dharma arises if a person listens to the Yagnavalkya Smruti, Manu Smruti, Parashar Smruti, Shankh - Likhit Smruti, and other Smrutis. By doing so, dharma will arise, and a person will develop belief in those shastras.
9.7 "Bhakti arises if a person understands the avatars of Bhagvan. How should he understand them? Well, when he hears about the murti of Bhagvan that are in each khand; and when he hears about the dham s of Bhagvan – Golok, Vaikunth, Brahmpur, Shvet- Dvip; and when he listens with a sense of admiration to the talks of the leelas of Bhagvan describing the creation, sustenance, and destruction of the universe; and when he listens with keen interest to the narration of the leelas of Ram, Krishna, and the other avatars of Bhagvan, then bhakti towards Bhagvan would develop.
9.8 "Now, even though a person in his initial stages has an immature mind, if he listens to the ceremonial Smrutis, dharma would develop. Later, after becoming firm in his observance of dharma, if he listens to shastras that explain upasana, then all three ( gnan, bhakti, and vairagya) would develop. These are the factors which lead to the development of the four qualities."

Loya – 10
Remaining Without Moh
10.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the morning of Magshar sud 8 [13th December, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was wearing a white dagli made of chhint and white surval. He had also tied a white feto around His head. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
10.2 Then, Nityanand Swami said, "In this world, there are some men who have such love for women and other objects, that if they were to be separated, they would not be able to live. There are others who have love for women and other objects, but it is not as intense. So, if they were to be separated, they would survive. In this way, there are two types of people. Now, if the first type of person, who involves himself in worldly life with love, were to meet Bhagvan, he would become attached to Bhagvan in the same way; if he were to be separated from Bhagvan, he would not be able to survive. Moreover, if the second person, with less love for worldly life, were to meet Bhagvan, he would have less love for Bhagvan as well. Is the difference between these two types of people due to karma s, or is it eternal?"
10.3 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Those differences are not inherently present in the jeev; instead, they arise as a result of karma s. How does this happen? Well, when a jeev performs a karma, the force of its vruttis can be of three levels: mild, medium, and intense. The force with which the vruttis attach themselves to the object, determines the effect of the karma upon the jeev. As a result, three levels of love arise due to these karma s."
10.4 Again, Nityanand Swami asked, "Do the three levels in the force of the vruttis occur as a result of the gun, or is there some other reason?"
10.5 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The three types of differences are not due to the gun; to be more precise, when only the indriyas indulge in an object, then a mild force results. When the indriyas indulge in an object along with the mind, a medium force develops. When all three – the indriyas, the mind, and the jeev – combine and indulge in an object, the vruttis develop an intense force. Even if that intense force affects only the eyes, the other indriyas would follow, and the force would affect them as well. In this way, whichever indriya is primarily affected by the intense force, the other indriyas follow. Moreover, that intense force affects all three types of people – rajasi, sattvik, and tamasi. In fact, such intense force is present in each of the indriyas; therefore, love for objects arises."
10.6 Then, Nityanand Swami asked, "Why does he not develop love for Bhagvan with such an intense force?"
10.7 Shreeji Maharaj said, "Good and bad behaviour is determined by the factors of desh, kal, kriya, dhyan, shastras, diksha, mantra, and sang. So, if a person attains pleasant factors, then he develops love for Bhagvan quickly. But, if he encounters unpleasant factors, then he would develop love for objects other than Bhagvan."
10.8 Then, Chaitanyanand Swami asked, "What should a person do in difficult times?"
10.9 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Whenever and wherever times are difficult, a person should abandon that place for another location; he should not stay where the factor of kal is unpleasant. In actual fact, kal, in the form of Satya-Yug, Treta-Yug, Dvapar-Yug, and Kali-Yug, exists both externally and internally. So, when Kali-Yug is prevalent within a person's heart, he should not visualise the murti of Bhagvan within his heart; instead, it should be seen externally, before his eyes."
10.10 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "How can a person distinguish whether a mild, a medium, or an intense force prevails within someone's heart?"
10.11 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "When the force is mild, a person would have the same feelings on seeing a young girl, a young woman, or an old woman. This is because only the vruttis of the indriyas have become involved. As a result, a mild force has developed. When the mind unites with the indriyas and they see the three types of women, then no improper thoughts arise towards the young girl or the old woman; but indecent thoughts certainly do arise towards the young woman, and a disturbance is experienced. This should be known as a medium level force. When both the mind and the jeev combine with the indriyas and look at the three types of women, then improper thoughts arise towards all three types of women, and a disturbance is experienced. In fact, a person would experience such improper thoughts even on seeing his own mother or sister. This should be known as an intense force."
10.12 Then, Brahmanand Swami asked, "Suppose a person notices the distinction between the three types of women, and notices their beauty and ugliness, yet he does not experience any improper thoughts. Which type of force is that?"
10.13 Shreeji Maharaj said, "Having realised an object to be the cause of intense misery and having reflected upon that fact, a person assigns serious flaws to that object. The reflection of those disadvantages in the mind then leads to those flaws being acknowledged by the jeev. The witness ( Bhagvan), who is greater than the jeev, also confirms those flaws, and so an extremely firm belief in those flaws is developed. Therefore, when the vruttis of the indriyas enter the object, the mind and jeev also go along with the vruttis; but since the jeev's deep belief of the flaw in the object pierces the mind and indriyas, even though the object is seen and fully recognised, an intense hatred still arises for it. For example, if a snake's venom is dropped into a bowl of sweet milk, and a person sees the venom being added, then even though the milk appears exactly as before, an intense hatred for it prevails in his heart. This is because he has realised, 'If I drink the milk, I will die'. Similarly, such a person has realised, 'This beautiful woman is an obstacle on the path of kalyan; and she is the cause of extreme misery in this lok and in the higher loks. In fact, I have attained the company of women countless times in past lives in various life-forms, and if I still do not worship Bhagvan, I will attain the company of countless more females. Therefore, this attainment is not rare. However, the company of Bhagvan and His sant is extremely rare, and this woman is a major obstacle in the attainment of that'. A person who has realised this and has intensely realised the flaws in the object, will never be infatuated on seeing a woman, regardless of how beautiful she may be.
10.14 "Furthermore, there is another way to remain free of infatuation: Janak the Videhi, who was a great king and a bhakta of Bhagvan, stayed in his kingdom and, due to his firmness in gnan, remained free of infatuation even while indulging in attractive vishays. Similarly, a bhakta with gnan like Janak, has the thought, 'I am the atma – pure, chaitanya, unchanging, blissful, and imperishable. However, vishays like women and other objects, are full of misery; they are worthless, perishable, and jad'. With this thought, he believes only his own self, the atma, as being blissful. Also, he believes, 'The pleasure and charm which are apparent in the vishays are only experienced due to the atma. But, when the atma leaves the body, that which was once pleasurable becomes miserable'. He reflects upon his atma in this way.
10.15 "He also reflects upon Paramatma, who is greater than the atma, as follows: 'I have attained this gnan of the pure atma, which is greater than maya, by the grace of the sant. That sant is a bhakta of Bhagvan. Moreover, that Bhagvan is the atma of even brahm, who is atma of all. He is the atma of Akshar, and is also the atma of the countless millions of muktas. I am the brahm-rup das of that Parbrahm Purushottam Narayan'.
10.16 "Also, he understands the greatness of Bhagvan by realising: dyupataya eva ten a yayur-antam anantataya tvamapi yad-antaranda-nichaya nanu savaranaha : Even the masters of the higher loks cannot understand your greatness, because it is endless. Neither can you yourself understand your own greatness. In your each and every hair, countless brahmands and their barriers (jad prakruti) fly simultaneously at immense speed – like specks of dust flying in the air. Even the Shrutis, ultimately perish in you, and fail to praise your glory." Such shloks have greatly explained the greatness of Bhagvan.
10.17 "When a person, who has gnan of his own self and of Bhagvan, attains a vishay, his mind would not even be slightly affected by it, regardless of how appealing it may be. He indulges in the essential vishays without becoming dependent upon them. Instead, he indulges in them independently of his own accord. Just as a spider spreads its own web and then it independently retracts it when necessary, in the same way, a bhakta possessing gnan engages the vruttis of his indriyas in the vishays and retracts them on his own accord. Such a person feels as if he is in the forest, even if he is amongst people; and though he may be in the forest, he experiences more happiness there than a person does from ruling a kingdom.
10.18 "The bhakta may reside in a kingdom, thousands of people may be under his command, and he may be wealthy; but he himself does not feel, 'I have become very great'. Furthermore, if the kingdom is destroyed and he begs for food from house to house with a clay bowl, he does not feel, 'Now I have become poor'. This is because he remains absolutely carefree in his own bliss, and he knows the greatness of his own self and that of Bhagvan. Therefore, he views gold, dirt, iron, and stones as equal; he also feels calmness in praise and insult. Since his vision has become broad, and he knows all worldly objects to be worthless, no objects are capable of binding a person with gnan. For example, when a man who was initially poor receives a kingdom, his vision becomes broad. At first, he may have been selling bundles of wood or doing various other insignificant jobs, but he forgets them all and he begins to do important tasks related to his kingdom. Similarly, to a person with gnan, all objects become worthless; and due to that gnan, his vision becomes broad. A person with such an understanding becomes happy.
10.19 "Also, if a person has faith, and he believes, 'Whatever such a great sant and Bhagvan say is the truth; there is no doubt in it', and with this belief he does as Bhagvan and His sant instruct him to do, then that person remains happy. These are the two types of people who are happy; apart from them, everyone is unhappy. This is also described in the following shlok: yash-cha mudhatamo loke yash-cha buddheha param gataha tavubho sukham-edhete klishya-tyantarito janaha : In this world, there are two types of people who experience the bliss of Bhagvan: those who are utterly ignorant and have blind faith in Bhagvan, and those who are perfectly enlightened and have realised Bhagvan. Those who are in between, are troubled.
10.20 "Also, in the Bhagvad Geeta, it is said: vishaya vinivar-tante niraharasya dehinaha rasa-varjam rasopyasya param drushtva nivartate : The sense objects recede for a person who refrains from indulging in them. However, the longing for them does not subside. The longing subsides only when his vision reaches Bhagvan." This means that all objects, except Bhagvan, become worthless to a person whose vision becomes alokik in this way. Moreover, the meaning of these two shloks is the same."
10.21 Then, Muktanand Swami said, "Maharaj, now please ask the question you were going to ask."
10.22 So, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Is there only misery in maya, or is there also some happiness in it? That is the question."
10.23 Muktanand Swami replied, "Maya causes only misery."
10.24 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Of the three gun – sattva-gun, rajo-gun, and tamo-gun – which arise from Maya, sattva-gun is said to give happiness. Furthermore, in the Shreemad Bhagvat it is said: sattvam yad-brahma-darshanam Sattva-gun leads to the vision of Bhagvan. "It is also said that the products of sattva-gun are gnan, vairagya, wisdom, tranquillity, and discipline. How is maya in this form a cause of misery? Furthermore, it is stated in the eleventh skandh: vidyavidye mama tanu viddhyud-dhava shareerinam; bandha-mokshakari adye mayaya me vinir-mite : O Uddhav! Realise my two forms – both of which have been created from my maya: the ancient vidya and avidya, which free and bind people respectively. "So, how is maya in the form of knowledge, which leads to moksh, a cause of misery?"
10.25 Hearing the question, Muktanand Swami and all the other paramhans said, "Maharaj, we are unable to answer, so please have mercy, and give the answer yourself."
10.26 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj said, "To a sinful person, the svarup of Yam- Raj appears frightful and terrible, with large teeth and a large, frightening mouth; he appears black like soot, huge like a mountain, and horrific like death. In this way, his svarup appears dreadful. However, to a good person, the svarup of Yam-Raj appears very pleasant, like Vishnu. Similarly, to those who are vimukhs, maya causes attachment and intense misery, while to a bhakta of Bhagvan that same maya is the cause of intense happiness. Also, the entities that have evolved out of Maya – the antah-karans, the indriyas, and their presiding devs – all support the bhakti of Bhagvan. Therefore, for a bhakta of Bhagvan, maya is not a cause of misery; it is a source of great happiness."
10.27 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "If maya is a cause of happiness, why is it that when a bhakta of Bhagvan visualises the murti of Bhagvan and engages in worship, maya, in the form of the antah-karans, causes misery by generating many disturbing thoughts?"
10.28 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Maya, in the form of the antah-karans, does not cause misery to a person who thoroughly understands the greatness of Bhagvan and has an absolutely firm refuge of Bhagvan; but it does cause misery to a person who does not have this refuge. For example, a kusangi would attempt to dislodge only a weak satsangi; but no one would dare to dislodge a firm satsangi. In fact, no one would be able to speak unkindly of satsang in his presence. Similarly, maya, in the form of the antah-karans, would never entertain a desire to intimidate a person who has a firm refuge in Bhagvan. Instead, it would help his bhakti to flourish. However, maya does deflect a person who has a slight deficiency in his refuge in Bhagvan, and does cause him misery. However, when that person develops a complete refuge in Bhagvan, maya is not able to disturb him or cause him pain. Therefore, the answer is that if a person has complete nishchay in Bhagvan, maya is not capable of causing him misery."

Beliefs Of A Sat And An Asat Person
11.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the morning of Magshar vad 8 [27th December, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sadhu s, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
11.2 Then, Shuk Muni asked Shreeji Maharaj, "What understanding does an asat-purush adopt from the Shreemad Bhagvat, the Bhagvad Geeta, and other sacred shastras?"
11.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The answer is as follows: An asat-purush person believes that all the sthavar and jangam male and female svarups in this world have been created through Maya and the Purush, Virat, and svarup of Bhagvan. This implies that all these svarups are manifestations of Bhagvan Himself. For this reason, a person aspiring for kalyan should initially conquer his mind; and then, if his mind is attracted towards a higher or lower svarup of either a male or female, he should perform dhyan upon that very svarup in order to attain instantaneous samadhi. If the mind perceives any flaws in that svarup, then he should believe that svarup to be brahm by thinking, 'The whole world is brahm'. Thinking in this way, he should disprove the perception of those flaws. In this way, to accept only the words regarding experiences from the shastras is the understanding of an asat-purush. Such a misunderstanding reflects the wicked nature of his mind, and at the end of his life, he is sent to the deep regions of Narak and the cycle of births and deaths."
11.4 Then, Shuk Muni requested, "Now, please explain what understanding a sat-purush person adopts from the sacred shastras."
11.5 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "The answer to this question is given in the sacred shastras themselves. Specifically, those desiring kalyan should not perform dhyan upon – with the exception of Purushottam Narayan – any devs, such as Shiv and Brahma. Instead, among all humans and devs, they should perform dhyan only upon murtis, such as Ram and Krishna, which are avatars of Purushottam Narayan. Furthermore, the wise bhaktas consider all the places where Bhagvan's murti of Ram and Krishna reside to be Vaikunth, Golok, Shvet- Dvip, and Brahmpur. They consider the parshads that dwell in those loks to be the parshads of Ram and Krishna, such as Hanuman and Uddhav.
11.6 "They also regard the divya murti s of Bhagvan in those loks, which are radiant with the light of countless millions of suns, moons, and flames of fire, to be murtis of avatars such as Ram and Krishna in their dhams. Therefore, a person who adopts such an understanding from the sacred shastras, and performs dhyan on the human svarup of Bhagvan with a sense of divinity, never equates the svarups of Bhagvan's avatars and other svarups. In reality, all murti s of Bhagvan's avatars have only two arms. However, for the sole reason of dismissing any similarity that a person lacking wisdom may perceive between Bhagvan's svarup and other svarups, they are often described as having four arms or eight arms.
11.7 "Moreover, a person should only perform dhyan on the murti of Bhagvan that he has attained, not on the murti s of the previous avatars. Therefore, like a woman who keeps the vow of fidelity, a person should remain totally faithful to the murti of Bhagvan that he has attained. Parvati has also said, koti janma-laga ragad hamari; varu Shambhu, ke rahu kumari : For a million lives I have done so; I'll marry Shambhu, or remain unwed. "Such a vow of fidelity has also been mentioned in order to dismiss the similarity that a person lacking wisdom perceives between the svarup of Bhagvan and other beings. This is because if someone strays from the murti of Bhagvan which he has attained, and instead performs dhyan on the previous avatars of that very Bhagvan, then he may later even abandon Bhagvan and perform dhyan upon other devs of other human svarups. That is why the vow of fidelity has been mentioned, not because there is any difference between the murti s of Bhagvan themselves. This is the understanding of a sat-purush. Therefore, a person should only hear the sacred shastras from a sat- purush person, but never from an asat-purush."

Savikalp And Nirvikalp Nishchay
12.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Magshar vad 9 [28th December, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was dressed entirely in white clothes, and was also wearing a red, woollen dagli. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
12.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj raised a question: "Nishchay in Bhagvan is of two types: savikalp nishchay and nirvikalp nishchay. In each type of nishchay there are three sub-categories: uttam, madhyam, and kanishth. Please describe the distinguishing characteristics of each of these six sub-categories."
12.3 The paramhans were unable to answer, so Shreeji Maharaj said, "The characteristics of a person with the kanishth savikalp nishchay are as follows: As long as Bhagvan exhibits kam, krodh, lobh, man, and svad, to the same extent as other humans, the person's nishchay in Bhagvan remains. However, if Bhagvan were to display these svabhav s more so than others, his nishchay would be shattered.
12.4 "The nishchay of someone with the madhyam savikalp nishchay remains firm even if Bhagvan exhibits kam and krodh to a double degree than that of humans.
12.5 "Finally, a person with the uttam savikalp nishchay would never doubt any action of Bhagvan, even if Bhagvan were to behave crudely like a person of a low varna and ashram; or exhibit anger or violence; or indulge in drinking alcohol, meat-eating, or adultery. This is because he understands Bhagvan to be the all-doer, the supreme lord, and the experience of everything. Such a person realises that whatever actions take place in the world are the result of Bhagvan, who is anvay within all beings as their controller. If He were to indulge in some shameful deed, it would not affect Him at all since He Himself is the all-doer. In this way, a person who has realised Bhagvan as the lord of all, is known as a bhakta of Bhagvan with the uttam savikalp nishchay.
12.6 "As for a bhakta with the kanishth nirvikalp nishchay, no matter what good or bad deeds he witnesses being performed by Bhagvan, he understands that in all actions Bhagvan performs, He is still a non-doer, since He is brahm. That brahm is like akash; everything resides in akash and all actions take place within it. The bhakta realises such qualities of brahm of Bhagvan. For example, during the narration of the ras-leela, Parikshit Raja asked Shukji, 'Bhagvan assumes an avatar to uphold dharma. Then, why did He associate with the gopis?' Shukji replied, 'Shree Krishna is radiant like fire; whatever actions He performs, good or bad, are burnt to ashes'. In this way, a person who understands Bhagvan as brahm, and unaffected by the actions He performs, is said to have the kanishth nirvikalp nishchay.
12.7 "A person who becomes like the niranna- muktas of Shvet- Dvip – who are free from the shad-urmi (six physical and emotional feelings) – and worships Vasudev, is said to possess a madhyam nirvikalp nishchay.
12.8 "Finally, a person possessing the uttam nirvikalp nishchay realises that countless millions of brahmands, each encircled by the eight barriers ( jad prakruti), appear like mere atoms before Akshar. Such is the greatness of Akshar, the dham of Purushottam Narayan. A person who worships Purushottam realising himself to be akshar-rup, can be said to possess the uttam nirvikalp nishchay."
12.9 Then, Chaitanyanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, how have these distinctions in nishchay arisen?"
12.10 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "When a mumukshu initially approaches a guru, several factors cause distinctions in his nishchay: the pleasantness and unpleasantness of desh, kal, sang, diksha, kriya, mantra, and shastras, with regards to the guru; as well as the intensity of his own shraddha. Therefore, a person should always associate with pleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang. Moreover, a person should acquire wisdom from a speaker who is calm and faultless."
12.11 Chaitanyanand Swami asked further, "If under such circumstances a person develops the kanishth nishchay, can it later develop into the uttam nishchay?"
12.12 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If the listener possesses extreme shraddha; and if he encounters pleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang; and if he encounters a guru with the uttam gnan, then the highest nishchay will develop. Otherwise, such nishchay would develop after many lives."

Not Being Overcome By Unpleasant Circumstances
13.1 In the early morning of Magshar vad 10 [30th December, 1820], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was wearing a red, woollen dagli and a white khes. He had tied a white feto around His head, and had tied a bokani with another white feto. In addition to this, He had covered Himself with a white chofal. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
13.2 Shreeji Maharaj then told the senior paramhans to ask questions amongst themselves. So, Gopalanand Swami asked Brahmanand Swami, "What type of person is overcome by unpleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang; and what type of person is not overcome? After all, it is said that even Brahma was infatuated upon seeing Sarasvati, as was Shivji when he saw Mohini. So, please answer carefully, because even such great devs have been overcome by unpleasant circumstances."
13.3 Brahmanand Swami attempted to answer, but could not give an adequate reply.
13.4 So, Shreeji Maharaj explained, "A person who has withdrawn his nadis and prans, and by way of his nirvikalp state remains at the holy feet of Bhagvan, would not be overcome by unpleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang, even if he was an insignificant being. In fact, if Brahma and other devs behave in this way; they would also not be overcome. However, if he has not developed such a state, and instead, behaves as if he is the body, then average beings, as well as great devs, would be overcome. If this were not so, then the meaning of the following shlok would not be true: tat-shrushta-shrushta-shrushteshu konvakhandita-dheehee puman rushim narayanam-rute yoshin-mayyeha mayaya : Of the progeny of Brahma (Marichi), and their progeny (Kashyap), and their progeny (humans and devs) – whose mind in this world, besides that of Narayan Rushi, can be distinguished as being unaffected by the maya and attractive charm of women?
13.5 "Therefore, Bhagvan alone is not overcome by those influences. While all others, no matter how great they may be, if they are not engrossed in the holy feet of Bhagvan, would be overcome; those who do remain engrossed are not overcome. This is a universal principle that I have firmly established within myself.
13.6 "Moreover, it is mentioned in the Shreemad Bhagvat: etad-eeshanam-eehasya prakrutisthopi tad-gunahee na yujyate sadatmasthair-yatha buddhis-tad-ashraya : Just as a person's buddhi (knowledge of Bhagvan) is not affected by the characteristics of the body (such as birth, death, age, illness), similarly, Bhagvan, who pervades Prakruti, is forever unaffected by their influences and the influences of atmas. This is the ability of Bhagvan.
13.7 "Krishna Bhagvan has also said: daivee hyesha guna-mayee mama maya duratyaya mam-eva ye prapadyante mayam-etam taranti te : My maya, which I have created and is composed of the three gun, is indeed difficult to rise above. However, those who take refuge in me alone can rise above that maya.
13.8 "Therefore, only Bhagvan remains unaffected by maya; and a person who has realised Bhagvan through a nirvikalp state is also not overcome by maya. On the other hand, someone who has realised Bhagvan through a savikalp state would still be overcome, no matter how great he may be."
13.9 Then, Nityanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, as long as a mukta is associated with the three gun ( sattva-gun, rajo-gun, tamo-gun), he is affected by desh, kal, kriya, and sang. However, it is accepted that Bhagvan is not influenced by desh, kal, kriya, and sang – even while He remains with the gun. However, when all the muktas are free from the association of the gun, and have become nirgun, they dwell in Akshardham along with Bhagvan – who dwells there in the same way; and all the muktas are nirgun, and composed of chaitanya. Also, as explained by 'mama sadharmya-magataha', they have attained qualities similar to those of Bhagvan. Then, how should we understand the distinction between the muktas and Bhagvan?"
13.10 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "Look at the moon and the stars. Is there not a difference between the two? They are not similar in terms of brightness, and there is a vast difference between the intensity of their rays. All the herbs are nourished by the moon, but not by the stars. Also, it is the moon that dispels the darkness of the night, not the stars. Bhagvan and the muktas differ in the same way.
13.11 "Also, a king and his servant are both the same, as they both are humans; yet the authority, power, beauty, and charm of the king are far more superior. His servant, regardless of how great he may be, cannot achieve what the king can achieve. In the same way, Purushottam Narayan is the all-doer, the cause of all, the controller of all; He is extremely attractive, extremely radiant, and extremely powerful; also, He possesses kartum, akartum, and anyatha- kartum powers. If He wishes, He can conceal all the muktas of Akshardham by His own divine light and prevail alone. Also, if He wishes, He can accept the bhakti of the muktas and reside with them. He can conceal even Akshar, in the svarup of Akshardham, in which He dwells, and preside alone. If He so chooses, He is capable of supporting the countless muktas by His own power, without even needing Akshardham. For example, Pruthu Bhagvan told Pruthvi, 'I can kill you with the arrow from my bow and still be able to support the whole world by my powers'. Likewise, through His powers, Bhagvan reigns as the supreme lord. A person who equates Bhagvan with Akshar and the other muktas should be regarded as evil-minded and as a great sinner. A person should avoid even looking at him. In fact, merely looking at such a person is as sinful as committing the five great sins.
13.12 "Of course, by considering their association with Bhagvan, it is acceptable to grant greatness upon anyone. Brahma, Shiv, Narad, the Sanakadik, and Uddhav can all be called Bhagvan because of their association with Bhagvan. At present, even a sadhu like Muktanand Swami can be considered to be like Bhagvan because of his association with Bhagvan. However, without Bhagvan, even Akshar cannot be called Bhagvan – let alone anyone else.
13.13 "This Vedic shlok reflects the same truth: aparimita dhurvas-tanubhruto yadi sarvagatas-tarhi na shasyateti niyamo dhruva netaratha : O loyal Bhagvan! If the embodied jeevs, which are innumerable and eternal, are believed to be all-pervasive, then they would not be governable. Not believing them as all-pervasive would not cause any discrepancies. "If this were not so, then why would we – despite regarding ourselves to be brahm-rup, and distinct from the body, and possessing gnan and vairagya – try to please Bhagvan by staying up day and night, clapping, singing kirtans, and chanting His holy name tirelessly? Why would we engage in katha s and talks day and night, and encourage others to do so as well? Why would we make so much effort if we could become like Bhagvan? Therefore, only Bhagvan is like Bhagvan; no one can become like Him. The Vedic shlok 'ekam-evadviteeyam brahm' also explains that Bhagvan alone is like Bhagvan. This is the principle of all the shastras."
13.14 In this way, Shreeji Maharaj addressed the bhaktas for their benefit, when in reality He Himself is Purushottam Narayan.

Personal Preference Of Shreeji Maharaj
14.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Magshar vad 11 [31st December, 1820], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was wearing a white khes, and had tied a white feto around His head. He had covered Himself with a white chadar. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
14.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said to the paramhans, "All the acharyas of the past have had differing beliefs. Of them, Shankar Swami seems to have leaned predominately towards the Advait principle. Ramanuj's principle is that jeev s, Maya, and Purushottam are eternal; Purushottam is the controller of the jeev s and Maya; He is the ultimate cause of all; He forever dwells in His Akshardham in a divya svarup; all avatars originate from Him; and it is this Purushottam Narayan that should be worshiped. This seems to be the understanding of Ramanuj. Vallabh-acharya seems to have intense faith only in bhakti. All these acharyas have occasionally referred to other principles in their own shastras, but ultimately, in one way or another, they have leaned towards their own personal preference. Their views can be accurately understood from the statements in their shastras.
14.3 "In the same way, having listened to my talks, what have all of you realised my personal preference to be? Just as a thread passes through the eye of a needle, or a thread runs through each and every bead of a mala, which principle is consistently interwoven in all of my talks? Please state your beliefs."
14.4 All the senior paramhans spoke according to their understanding.
14.5 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Here, allow me to reveal my own principles and preferences.
14.6 "First of all, I like the fact that although Rushabh- Dev Bhagvan had attained oneness with Vasudev, and despite being Bhagvan Himself, when siddhi appeared before Him, He did not accept them because He wished to set an example for all tyagis. Also, the Shreemad Bhagvat states: 'Even an accomplished yogi should never trust his mind – even though he may appear to have conquered it'.
14.7 "There are also these shloks: na kuryat-karhichit-sakhyam manasi hyanavasthite yadvistram-bhachirach-cheernam chaskanda tapa aishvaram : Never befriend the mind because it is very unstable; it has even destroyed the tap of the devs that were accumulated after extensive activities over a great period of time. nityam dadati kamasya-chhidram tam-anu yerayaha yoginaha kruta-maitrasya patyur-jayeva punshchalee : The minds of those yogis who have befriended their minds continuously allow kam to enter. Other enemies, such as krodh, lobh, and moh, follow the kam into the mind. In this way, the mind brings about the downfall of the yogis, just as an unfaithful wife brings about the downfall of her trusting husband. "In this way, I like a tyagi who does not trust his mind.
14.8 "Also, in my mind I do not like other loks as much as I like Shvet-Dvip and Badrikashram. In fact, I feel that it would be very good to go there to perform tap without any food. I would prefer not to indulge in the various types of pleasures of the other loks.
14.9 "Furthermore, I realise that the many avatars are all ultimately of Bhagvan; yet, among these avatars, I like Rushabh-Dev greatly. I also like Kapil-Dev and Dattatrey equally, but to a lesser extent than Rushabh-Dev. But, more than these three, I have a million-fold more love for the avatar of Shree Krishna. I feel, 'This avatar is greater and more powerful than all the others. Also, in him, a person cannot make the distinction of the avatar and the source of the avatar'. On the other hand, I do not have a great liking for the other avatars of Bhagvan, such as Matsya and Kurma.
14.10 "In addition to this, my understanding is as follows: There is a great mass of divine light, which cannot be measured from above, below, or in any of the four directions; it is endless. Amidst this mass of light lies a large sinhasan, upon which presides the divya murti of Shree Narayan Purushottam Bhagvan. Countless millions of muktas are seated around that sinhasan, enjoying the darshan of Bhagvan. I constantly see Him accompanied by the muktas. Moreover, that Bhagvan is extremely luminous. At times, when I cannot see Bhagvan with the sabha of muktas due to this luminosity, I feel deeply hurt. Despite being able to constantly see this mass of divine light, I am not fascinated by it; I experience profound bliss only from the darshan of Bhagvan's murti. This is my upasana.
14.11 "Moreover, I like the bhakti that the gopis had towards Bhagvan. For this reason, I continuously observe people, and having seen the love a lustful woman has for a man, or a lustful man has for a woman, I feel, 'It would be good to have such love for Bhagvan'. Also, whenever I see someone having great love for their son, or their money, I again feel, 'It would be good to have such love for Bhagvan'. That is why whenever I hear someone singing, I would either send someone to that person, or I would personally go there, and I would feel, 'What he is doing, is very good'.
14.12 "Also, I only get along with a person who has no svabhav s, such as kam, krodh, lobh, man, irshya, kapat, svad, sneh, dambh; a person who follows dharma as prescribed in the Dharma-Shastras; and a person who has bhakti towards Bhagvan. I enjoy the company of only such a person. If a person is not like that, then I do not get along with him, even if he is staying close to me. In fact, I feel a dislike towards them.
14.13 "Initially, I had a strong dislike for anyone with kam. However, now I have a strong dislike for those who have krodh, man, or irshya. The reason is that a person with kam passes his days in satsang by being humble – like a grahastha bhakta; but as for those who have krodh, man, or irshya, they can be seen to definitely regress in satsang. For this reason, I am deeply saddened by these types of people.
14.14 "What is man like? Well, a person with man remains arrogant even before those who are superior to him; he cannot become humble and serve them.
14.15 "Now, allow me to summarise my preferences in brief. I do not agree with Shankar Swami's belief of Advait principle. Ramanuj Swami describes Purushottam Bhagvan as greater than the perishable and the imperishable; I worship that Purushottam Bhagvan. My bhakti towards that Purushottam Bhagvan is like that of the gopis, and the qualities of vairagya and atma-nishtha within me are like Shukji's and Jadbharat's. These are my principles and preferences. Intelligent bhaktas can realise this if they analyse my talks as well as the shastras of our sampraday which have been accepted by me as trustworthy."
14.16 Therefore, Shreeji Maharaj spoke for the sake of His bhaktas, while He Himself is Purushottam Narayan.

Loya – 15
atma- Darshan
15.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Magshar vad 13 [2nd January, 1821], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was wearing a warm, red dagli and a white khes. He had tied a white feto around His head, and had tied a bokani with another white feto. In addition to this, He had covered Himself with a chofal and a pachhedi. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
15.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said out of compassion, "The jeev pervades the entire body from head to toe through its three powers of adhyatma, adhibhut, and adhidev. Through the indriyas, and their presiding devs, it experiences the vishays, but it cannot experience anything by being distinct from the presiding devs and the indriyas."
15.3 Then, Nityanand Swami raised a doubt: "Maharaj, it is said that the jeev pervades the whole body in general, but resides specifically within the heart. So, how should a person understand the fact that awareness is not present everywhere equally?"
15.4 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "The sun pervades each and every object equally by its rays, but its light is seen according to the object it shines upon. For example, pure sunlight is not experienced as intensely on stone or sand or in dirty water as it is on a floor made of glass or in clean water. Therefore, just as a person experiences a greater and lesser intensity in the sun's light, in the same way, even though the jeev resides equally in the indriyas, the antah-karans, and the organs of the indriyas, a person experiences its power more intensely in the indriyas because of their purity. For example, does a person experience as much sensation in his nose and ears as he does in his eyes? Certainly not. Furthermore, the four antah-karan s are even purer than the indriyas, and so the jeev's power can be experienced there even more intensely. In comparison, it is experienced to a lesser degree in the indriyas. Nevertheless, the jeev does pervade the entire body equally."
15.5 Then, Brahmanand Swami asked, "Many see the jeev to be like a star, or like the flame of an oil lamp, or like the flash from a firecracker. How should a person understand these differences in experiences?"
15.6 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "Just as a person who has mastered akshi-vidya can see the jeev and the murti of Bhagvan within with his eyes, a person who has realised the atma through the indriyas sees the atma in a similar way. For example, if there was a glass-statue shaped in the svarup of a human – with all of its limbs, hair, and vessels made of glass – and if it were filled with light, then the light would be seen only according to the size and shape of the tubes within; it would not be seen everywhere. In the very same way, people describe the nature of the jeev according to however they have seen it. However, because they have not attained niravaran drashti, they do not see the atma as it is. However, when a person who has not attained niravaran drashti and is one with his atma, he no longer perceives the divisions of the different organs of the indriyas; instead, he realises the atma as it truly is.
15.7 "Just as a person who has attained the viewpoint of akash does not perceive the other four bhuts, similarly, a person with niravaran drashti does not perceive differences in the jeev's light arising from its indriyas, their organs and presiding devs, and the antah-karans; instead, he realises the jeev precisely as it is. On the other hand, a person who perceives distinctions does not realise the jeev as it is. For example, from a group of people, one person saw the tail of a cow, one person saw its mouth, one person saw its hoof, one person saw its belly, and one person saw its udder. Whichever part of the cow was seen, belonged to the cow, yet no one saw the cow completely. However, because at least one part was seen, it can be said that the cow was actually seen. In the same way, a person can be said to have had the darshan of the atma to the extent to which he has seen the light of the atma through his indriyas or antah-karans. However, this cannot be said to be perfect darshan of the atma. Therefore, I have explained the general and the specific experiences of the jeev in this way."
15.8 At that point, Nityanand Swami questioned, "Maharaj, you have described the jeev as being nirakar. Therefore, when Bhagvan dwells within the jeev, does He reside without a svarup, or does He possess a svarup?"
15.9 Shreeji Maharaj clarified, "Bhagvan dwells as the refuge of the indriyas, the antah-karans, their presiding devs, and the jeev. For example, Shree Krishna Bhagvan made Uddhavji explain to the gopis, 'I am near to you by being the refuge of your indriyas, antah-karans, their presiding devs, and the jeev. Just as the very same five maha-bhuts which reside in the brahmands are also within everyone's body, similarly, I reside in Mathura like the maha-bhuts reside predominantly in the brahmands; but just like those maha-bhuts reside subtly in the bodies of the jeevs, I also reside within all of you. The fact that I cannot be seen is to keep the vrutti of your mind confined within me; that is why I cannot be seen. Nevertheless, I reside within you, and I possess a definite murti'."
15.10 Hearing this, Nityanand Swami questioned further, "Maharaj, does Bhagvan, who resides as the refuge of the indriyas, antah-karans, their presiding devs, and the jeev, reside in the svarup of Purush, Akshar, or as Purushottam Himself?"
15.11 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The light of the jeev, Purush, Akshar, and Purushottam is very similar in terms of luminosity. So much so, that no one is capable of distinguishing between their light. However, they are absolutely distinct from each other, but no one is capable of seeing these distinctions. Only a person who receives a divine body composed of divine light by the grace of Bhagvan realises, 'This is my own self, this is Purush, this is Akshar, and this is Purushottam – who is distinct from all'. In this way, a person can see them separately, and their light distinctly. However, no one else is capable of distinguishing between them. Therefore, Bhagvan may reside in whichever svarup He chooses, but it is He Himself who resides within the jeev – no one else."
15.12 Then, Shreeji Maharaj continued, "There are three sets of shastras which are eternal and which describe only the svarup of Shree Krishna Bhagvan. They are Yog, Sankhya, and Vedant (the Upanishads). I shall now explain the principles of each, so please listen.
15.13 "Those belonging to the Sankhya philosophy propose the existence of twenty-four tattvas and believe that Bhagvan is greater than them; that is, Bhagvan is the twenty-fifth tattva. However, they do not accept jeev and ishvar as being distinct from the twenty-four tattvas. Their reasoning is that the tattvas cannot be sustained without the jeev; so the jeev is imagined only as a form of the tattvas because of its close co-existence with them. As a result, they do not consider the jeev to be distinct. Also, just as they regard the jeev as a form of the tattvas, they regard the ishvars as a form of the twenty-four tattvas. In this way, they imagine both jeev and ishvar among the twenty-four tattvas, and therefore count them together with the twenty-four tattvas; they do not consider them as being distinct from the tattvas. This, along with believing Bhagvan to be the twenty-fifth tattva, is the philosophy of Sankhya.
15.14 "Despite this, a person should not conclude that there is no jeev at all, because the proposers of Sankhya have prescribed the six spiritual activities ( shat-sampatti – sham, dam, uparati, titiksha, samadhan, and shraddha) as well as shravan, manan, and nididhyas, for the jeev. By behaving in this way, the jeev attains a thought that eventually leads to the realisation of its distinction from the tattvas. Then, a person engages in the worship of Bhagvan, realising himself to be brahm-rup. This is the Sankhya philosophy. It is also mentioned in the Moksh-Dharma, where Naradji explains to Shukdevji: tyaja dharmam-adharma cha ubhe satyanrute tyaja ubhe satyanrute tyaktva yena tyajasi tat-tyaja" The meaning of this shlok is that when a mumukshu prepares to think about his atma, he should abandon all thoughts of dharma and adharma, satya and asatya, which disturb him. In fact, he should also abandon the thought by which he abandons these other thoughts. In this way, he should behave as brahm-rup. However, the shlok does not suggest that a person should physically abandon the niyams in the form of dharma. This is the correct interpretation of the shlok.
15.15 "Next, proposers of the Yog philosophy promote the twenty-four tattvas distinctly from the jeev and ishvar, whom they regard as the twenty-fifth tattva, and Bhagvan as the twenty-sixth. With the power of discrimination they distinguish the twenty-fifth tattva ( jeev) from the other tattvas, and after firmly resolving that to be their form, they gather the vruttis of the twenty-four tattvas and forcefully attach them to the twenty-sixth tattva ( Bhagvan); they do not allow them to be drawn towards the vishays. They believe, 'If my vruttis abandon Bhagvan and wander elsewhere, I will have to pass through the cycle of births and deaths'. Therefore, they forcibly keep the vruttis of their indriyas and antah-karans on Bhagvan.
15.16 "In comparison, the proposers of Sankhya believe, 'I have no indriyas or antah-karans, so where shall the vruttis go?' Therefore, they consider themselves to be brahm-rup and remain fearless. Those belonging to the Yog philosophy remain constantly fearful. For example, if a person had to carry a pot filled to the brim with oil up some stairs without spilling any oil at all, and if two swordsmen with drawn swords were on both sides trying to frighten him, that person would be extremely afraid. Followers of Yog remain just as afraid of the vishays and strive to keep their vrutti fixed on Bhagvan. This is the philosophy of Yog.
15.17 "Vedant (the Upanishads) explains only Bhagvan, who is the ultimate cause of all, as being the truth; they claim all else to be false. Just as when a person attains the viewpoint of akash, he does not perceive the other tattvas, in the same way, a person who sees only brahm, perceives nothing else. That is the philosophy of Vedant."

Worldly Desires Becoming Blunt And Uprooted
16.1 In the Samvat year 1877, after the sandhya arti on Magshar vad 14 [3rd January, 1821], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was wearing a white khes and a warm, red dagli. He has also tied a white feto around His head, and had tied a bokani with another white feto. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
16.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "May the paramhans please engage in a question-answer discussion."
16.3 Then, Maharaj Himself asked a question: "What are the characteristics of a person whose worldly desires have not become blunt, whose worldly desires have become blunt, and whose worldly desires have been completely uprooted?"
16.4 Muktanand Swami began to answer the question, but could not reply adequately.
16.5 So, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The vruttis of the indriyas of a person whose worldly desires have not become blunt, cling to the vishays. In fact, they cannot be dislodged even by a thought process. In comparison, the vruttis of a person whose worldly desires have become blunt do not enter the vishays immediately. If the vruttis were to enter the vishays, and he attempts to withdraw them, they would withdraw instantly; they would not remain attached to the vishays. However, a person whose worldly desires have become completely uprooted is unaware of the vishays during the jagrat state, just as he is during the sushupti state. He would regard all pleasant and unpleasant vishays as equal and would behave as a person who is gunatit."
16.6 Then, Gopalanand Swami asked, "A person's worldly desires may have become blunt, but what is the reason for them not being removed from their roots?"
16.7 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The answer is that if a person has perfectly absorbed the following four qualities, then his worldly desires will become uprooted: gnan in the form of knowledge of that atma; vairagya in the form of detachment from all things that have evolved out of Prakruti; dharma in the form of brahm-charya; and bhakti coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness. Any deficiency in these four qualities leads to a deficiency in uprooting a person's worldly desires."
16.8 Having given the reply, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Now, allow me to ask a question. Countless spiritual activities have been prescribed for a mumukshu to perform in order to attain Bhagvan. Out of all of them, by which one powerful activity can all flaws be eradicated and all gun be acquired?"
16.9 The paramhans could not answer the question.
16.10 So, Shreeji Maharaj revealed, "If a person has bhakti coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's countless powers as described by Kapil- Dev to Devhuti, then all of his flaws would be eradicated: mad-bhayad-vati vato-yam suryas-tapati mad-bhayat : It is by fear of me that Vayu (wind) blows, Surya (sun) shines, Indra (clouds) rains, Agni (fire) burns, and Yam (death) devours the living "Moreover, even if a person does not possess gnan, vairagya, and dharma, he still attains them. Therefore, this spiritual activity is the best of all."
16.11 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked another question: "A person with kapat, who is also clever, cunningly conceals his kapat. Please explain how such a person's kapat can be recognised?"
16.12 Brahmanand Swami answered, "Such a person can be recognised by the fact that he keeps the company of someone who is an enemy of satsang and who speaks unkindly of Bhagvan and His sant. Such a person cannot be known by any other means."
16.13 Shreeji Maharaj accepted the answer, but questioned further, "Yes, but how can such a person be recognised if he does not keep the company of such people?"
16.14 Brahmanand Swami then added, "His kapat would be exposed in times of difficult circumstances."
16.15 Shreeji Maharaj confirmed, "That is the correct answer to the question."
16.16 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked another question: "Which single avgun transforms all of a person's gun to avgun?"
16.17 Shreepat Devanand Swami replied, "If someone criticises a bhakta of Bhagvan, then all of his gun become as good as avgun."
16.18 Shreeji Maharaj clarified, "That is true, but I had another answer in mind. A person may well be endowed with each and every gun, but if he believes Bhagvan to be nirakar, then that is a great flaw. So much so, that because of this avgun, all of his gun become avgun."
16.19 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Why does a person perceive avgun in a sadhu?"
16.20 The paramhans attempted to answer the question, but were unable to give a precise answer.
16.21 So, Shreeji Maharaj answered the question Himself: "A person with man perceives avgun in a sadhu. This is because it is the very nature of someone who has man, that if someone praises him, even though that person may have a hundred avgun, he would overlook them and would instead greatly highlight a single gun. Conversely, if a person does not praise him, then even though that person may have a hundred gun, he would overlook all of them and highlight an utterly insignificant avgun. Consequently, he would initially spite the person mentally, then verbally, and ultimately physically as well. Therefore, man is a great flaw. However, do not think that only the wise have man and the naïve do not. In actual fact, the naïve have more man than the wise."
16.22 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, how can man be eradicated?"
16.23 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "A person who thoroughly realises the greatness of Bhagvan does not have man. Look at Uddhavji, and how wise he was! He was skilled in the Niti-Shastra, and had physical characteristics like that of a king. However, as he had understood the greatness of Bhagvan, he put aside his man upon seeing the love of the gopis for Bhagvan, and prayed, 'May I become a tree, a vine, a blade grass, or maybe a shrub – anything that has been touched by the dust from the feet of the gopis'.
16.24 "Tulsidas has also said: tulsee jyake mukhanse bhoole nikase ram take pag kee paheniyam mere tan kee cham" This means that even if someone utters the name of Bhagvan unintentionally, a person who realises Bhagvan's greatness would make shoes from his own skin and offer them to that person. If that is so, would he have any man before a bhakta of Bhagvan who constantly engages himself in worship and in chanting the name of Bhagvan, who bows down to Bhagvan, and who realises the greatness of Bhagvan? Certainly not. Therefore, man is eradicated when a person realises the greatness of Bhagvan, but without understanding the greatness of Bhagvan, man simply cannot be eradicated. Therefore, whoever wishes to eradicate man should realise the greatness of Bhagvan and His sant."

Not Perceiving Avgun
17.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Magshar vad Amas [4th January 1821], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He had tied a white feto around His head, and had tied a bokani with another white feto. He was also wearing a warm, red dagli with a white angarkhu inside. He was also wearing a white khes. In addition to this, He had covered Himself with a chofal, over which He had wrapped a yellow rajai. Shreeji Maharaj was in a pleasant mood. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
17.2 Then, of His own will, Shreeji Maharaj said, "See how powerful the force of Bhagvan's maya is! It can cause great wickedness. Someone who previously seemed very good, can suddenly become extremely evil."
17.3 So saying, Shreeji Maharaj urged the paramhans, "Ask questions today, so that we can talk."
17.4 Then, Nityanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, the very same person who was previously good and who prays to Bhagvan, later begins to criticise Him. How can a good person remain good and never let his understanding become impaired, amidst even the most unpleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang?"
17.5 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "If a person is indifferent to his body, has firm atma-nishtha, maintains vairagya towards the panch-vishays, and has absolute nishchay in Bhagvan coupled with the knowledge of His greatness, then his mind will never become distorted – even amidst the most unpleasant circumstances imaginable. On the other hand, a person who believes himself to be the body, and does not have an intense hatred for the panch-vishays, would spite a sadhu if he were to criticise the vishays, even though the sadhu may be senior. Such a person would ultimately spite Bhagvan as well. Furthermore, if someone has firm nishchay in Bhagvan, but lacks an extreme hatred towards the vishays and is still attracted to them, then even if a person like Muktanand Swami were to criticise those objects, he would go as far as to cut off the person's head with a sword in order to harm that person."
17.6 "Nityanand Swami then asked, "Someone may identify himself with the body and may be attracted to the panch-vishays; yet he seems to survive in satsang. How can this be explained?"
17.7 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "He survives in satsang only as long as he is not confronted by an unpleasant situation. If a great sadhu or Bhagvan were to criticise his man, svad, lobh, kam, krodh, or his belief that he is the body, then he would surely develop a dislike for the sadhu. Then, he would certainly insult the sadhu, and therefore fall from satsang. For example, whoever has drank sweetened milk that has been poisoned by the venom of a snake, even though he may be living at present, is sure to die – within half an hour, in the morning or in the evening, today or tomorrow; eventually, he will die. In the same way, he who identifies himself with the body, will definitely dislike the sadhu, and will eventually fall from satsang – either after one month or after two months; after one year or after two years or even after ten years; or maybe at the time of death or even after death – but he will certainly fall.
17.8 "In comparison, there is a person who does not identify himself with the body and believes, 'I am the atma, due to which this body functions; I am sachidanand; I enlighten the indriyas and antah-karans. I am not a person who becomes happy by possessing wealth and women; nor am I a person who is saddened by not possessing them'. Such a person never dislikes a sadhu, no matter how strongly the sadhu criticises the panch-vishays or the belief that he is the body. Furthermore, he would never quarrel with the sadhu over insignificant issues, and nor would he hold a grudge against him."
17.9 Then, Nityanand Swami asked again, "How can a person recognise someone who has a hatred for the panch-vishays?"
17.10 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "A person with a hatred for the panch-vishays can be recognised by the following characteristics: When he receives luxurious food, he would eat it, but he would not enjoy it as much as he would enjoy eating simple food. In fact, he would be troubled by it. Also, he would become upset wearing fine clothes; he would not enjoy them as much as he would enjoy wearing tattered, coarse clothes. In fact, his mind becomes troubled by fine clothes. If he were to receive a luxurious bed, or if someone were to honour him, or if he were to receive any sort of pleasant object, his mind would become troubled by it; in no way would he be pleased by it. On seeing such a person, a person should realise, 'He has a hatred for the vishays'. "
17.11 Then, Muktanand Swami asked another question, "Maharaj, how can a hatred for the panch-vishays be developed?"
17.12 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The most important method for developing such a hatred for the panch-vishays, is the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness, followed by atma- nishtha and vairagya.
17.13 "Now, what is this greatness of Bhagvan? Well, it is due to the fear of Bhagvan that Indra rains; that the sun, the moon, and flames of fire emit light; that the earth supports one and all; that the oceans do not exceed their boundaries; and that the herbs produce fruit in their appropriate seasons. Also, it is Bhagvan who is the creator, sustainer, and destroyer of the world, and whose powers include Kal, Maya, Purush, and Akshar. Then, what object in the world can attract someone who has understood the greatness of Bhagvan in this way? Well, not even k am, krodh, lobh, man, irshya, svad, fine clothes, wealth, women, and none of the panch-vishays can bind him. This is because he has assessed everything. He knows, 'Bhagvan is like this, and these are the rewards of engaging in Bhagvan's worship and listening to kathas and talks. Akshar is like this, and the bliss associated with him is like this. Furthermore, the pleasures of Golok, Vaikunth, and Shvet-Dvip are like this, the pleasures of Prakruti and Purush are like this, the pleasures of Brahm-Lok are like this, the pleasures of Svarg are like this, and the happiness of a kingdom is like this'.
17.14 "In this way, a person who has understood the happiness hidden within everything, realises the bliss of Bhagvan to be the highest and then attaches himself to Him. Is there any object in the world that can draw him away from the holy feet of Bhagvan? There is none. For example, take a piece of iron. Once touched by a parasmani, it is transformed into gold. It cannot be transformed back into iron; not even by the parasmani itself. Similarly, a person who has realised the greatness of Bhagvan cannot be made to fall from the holy feet of Bhagvan, not even by Bhagvan Himself. Then, how could he be made to fall by any other object? Of course he cannot.
17.15 "In addition to realising the greatness of Bhagvan, such a person also deeply realises the greatness of a sant who worships Bhagvan. He feels, 'This sant is truly great because he is a true bhakta of Bhagvan'. For example, Uddhav was very educated, but as he had understood the greatness of Bhagvan, he did not become arrogant due to his intelligence. In fact, he yearned for the dust from the feet of the gopis, and therefore asked to be reborn as a vine. The reason for this was that he had witnessed the profound love the gopis had towards Bhagvan, whom even the shloks of the Veds seek. So, how can a person who realises the greatness of a sant of Bhagvan hold any arrogance before a sant? Why could he not bow down to him? In actual fact, he would behave as a das of a das before a sant. Even if a sant were to repeatedly physically mistreat him, he would tolerate it and would believe, 'It is my great fortune that I am bearing the hatred of such a sant. Due to my prarabdha, I would have been forced to endure the abuses of my wife and children, my parents, and the king. I may even have had to eat the leaves of spinach and moss. At least here, in the company of the sant, I am fortunate enough to be able to keep the vow of nisvad. Due to my prarabdha, I may have been forced to wear tattered clothes or rags; but at least here with the sant I am fortunate enough to have a blanket to cover myself with'.
17.16 "Conversely, if a person enters a sabha of sadhu s and is not appropriately honoured by a sant, and if he then has a dislike towards that sant, it implies that he has not realised the greatness of the sant; otherwise he would not have a dislike towards the sant in that way. Consider the following as an example: If the British Governor of Mumbai were seated in an assembly, and if at that time a poor man were to enter that assembly, but was not given a seat or welcomed in anyway, would the poor man become angry with the Governor? Would he feel like swearing at the Governor? Not at all. This is because the poor man has realised the importance of the British official, and thinks, 'He is the ruler of the land, and I am a mere pauper'. For this reason, he does not become upset. In the same way, if a person has realised the greatness of a sant, then regardless of how much the sant hates him, he would never become upset with that sant. If fact, if he does find an avgun in anyone, he would find it in himself, but in no way would he perceive an avgun in the sant. Therefore, a person who has realised the greatness of Bhagvan and His sant has a firm foundation in satsang. Conversely, a person cannot be certain about someone who has not realised such greatness."

Nishchay In Bhagvan
18.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Posh sud 1 [5th January, 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in Sura Khachar's darbar in Loya. He was wearing a white khes and a warm, red dagli. In addition to this, He had covered Himself with a chofal and a rajai. He had tied a white feto around His head, and had tied a bokani with another white feto. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
18.2 Then, after the paramhans had finished the sandhya arti and prayers, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please sing a kirtan." Then, Muktanand Swami and some other paramhans sang kirtans while playing musical instruments.
18.3 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Please conclude the singing as I wish to talk. If any doubts arise in what I say, please ask."
18.4 So saying, He began, "To develop nishchay in Bhagvan is more difficult than anything else. Also, as this topic of nishchay is extremely complex, I am afraid of discussing it. I feel, 'Upon discussing this topic, what if someone was to misunderstand it? What if, due to this discussion, any characteristic that a person may have firmly developed were to be destroyed or uprooted?' However, there is no alternative but to reveal this fact. If a person does not interpret it correctly, many problems can arise. But, until a person has not understood this fact, a great deficiency will remain in his understanding. That is why I wish to deliver this talk.
18.5 "When Bhagvan assumed the svarup of Varah, His svarup as a boar was very ugly. During the avatar of Matsya, His svarup was exactly like that of a fish. During the Kurma avatar, His svarup was exactly like that of other turtles. In the Nrusinh avatar, His svarup was as frightening as a lion. During the Vaman avatar, His svarup was like a dwarf, with short hands and legs, a board waist and a plump body. During the Vyas avatar, He appeared black, with lots of body hair and a foul body odour.
18.6 "All those who attained Bhagvan in whichever svarup He had taken, performed dhyan on that particular svarup. As a result of that meditation, they attained a svarup similar to that svarup of Bhagvan. Now, did those who attained Varah, see Bhagvan exactly like a boar in His dham? Did those who attained Matsya, see Bhagvan exactly like a fish in His dham? Did those who attained Kurma, see Bhagvan exactly like a turtle in His dham? Did those who attained Nrusinh see Bhagvan exactly like a lion in His dham? Did those who attained Hayagriv see Bhagvan exactly as a horse in His dham? Did those who worshipped Varah as if He were their husband become a female boar? Did those who worshipped Him with the love of a friend become a boar? Did those who worshipped Matsya as if He were their husband become a female fish? Did those who worshipped Him with the love of a friend become a fish? Did those who worshipped Kurma as if He were their husband become a female turtle? Did those who worshipped Him with the love of a friend become a turtle? Did those who worshipped Nrusinh as if He were their husband become a lioness? Did those who worshipped Him with the love of a friend become a lion? Did those who worshipped Hayagriv as if He were their husband become a female horse? Did those who worshipped Him with the love of a friend become a horse? If the original svarup of Bhagvan was exactly like that of the avatar, then by meditating on them, the bhaktas of each avatar should attain that same svarup, and all that I have just mentioned should happen. However, this is not the case.
18.7 "Then, you may ask, 'What is the svarup of that Bhagvan like?' Well, the answer is that Bhagvan is sachidanand, and possesses a murti full of divine light. In every single pore of His body, there is light equivalent to millions and millions of suns. Moreover, that Bhagvan is so handsome that He puts even millions of Kam- Devs to shame. He is the lord of countless millions of brahmands, the king of kings, the controller of all, the antaryami of all, and extremely blissful. In comparison to His bliss, the pleasure of seeing countless beautiful women fades into insignificance. In fact, before the bliss of the murti of the Bhagvan, the pleasures of the vishays of this lok and the higher loks fade into insignificance. Such is the svarup of Bhagvan. That svarup always has two arms, but by His wish, He may appear to have four arms, or sometimes may appear to have eight arms, or He may even be seen as having a thousand arms.
18.8 "Furthermore, it is that very Bhagvan who assumes the svarup such as Matsya, Kurma, Varah, and the svarup of Ram and Krishna, for the purpose of fulfilling some task. However, he does not abandon His original svarup to assume the svarup of these avatars. That Bhagvan Himself assumes the svarups like Matsya and Kurma, possessing countless divine powers and great strength. Then, once the task for which He assumed a body is completed, He abandons that body. For this reason, it is said in the Shreemad Bhagvat: bhu-bharaha kshapito yena tam tanum vijahavajah kantakam kantakeneva dvayam chapeeshituhu samama" This shlok explains that through whichever physical body Bhagvan relieved the burden of the earth, after removing the 'thorn' (the belief that a person is the body) which has pierced the chaitanya of the beings, Bhagvan also abandoned His own physical body, which was the 'thorn' used to remove the other 'thorn'.
18.9 "Also, Bhagvan assumed the svarup of Nrusinh for the purpose of killing a demon. After completing that task, He decided to abandon that particular body. But, who could kill a lion? So, by Bhagvan's own will, Shiv (in the form of Kal), came assuming the svarup of a sharabh. Nrusinh then fought the sharabh. As a result, both left their physical bodies. That is how Shiv came to be known as Sharbheshvar Mahadev, and the location where Nrusinhji left his body became Narsinhi Shila.
18.10 "Moreover, wherever paintings of Matsya, Kurma, and other avatars of Bhagvan are portrayed, the lower portions of the paintings depict the svarup as the avatar, like a fish or a turtle. However, the upper portions of the paintings depict the murti of Bhagvan with a shankh, a chakra, a gada, a padma, a vaijayanti garland, silk garments, a crown, and the shrivatsa mark, as well as other symbols. Therefore, the murti of Bhagvan is eternally like this.
18.11 "Initially, at the time of His birth, Shree Krishna Bhagvan gave darshan in a four-armed svarup to Vasudev and Devki. He also gave darshan to Akrur in water in a four-armed svarup. When Rukmani fainted, He again gave darshan in a four-armed svarup. Arjun has also said: tenaiva rupena chatur-bhujen sahasra-baho bhava vishvamurte : O one whose form is the svarup! O thousand-armed! lease return to your original four-armed svarup!" So, Arjun also saw Him as having a four-armed svarup. When Shree Krishna Bhagvan was seated under a pipal tree after the Yadavs had slaughtered themselves, Uddhavji and Maitreya Rushi saw the svarup of Bhagvan having four-arms, along with a shankh, a chakra, a gada, a padma, and silk garments. Moreover, Shree Krishna Bhagvan was dark in complexion, yet His beauty is described as being capable of putting millions of Kam- Devs to shame.
18.12 "Therefore, although Bhagvan appears to be like a human, the previously mentioned luminosity and bliss are all inherent within Him. A person who has the strengths of dhyan, dharna, and samadhi, sees that very svarup of having the light of millions and millions of suns; such a person does not need to resort to using a torch or an oil lamp. Moreover, even though Bhagvan is so luminous, the fact that this divine light cannot be seen is due to Bhagvan's wish. If Bhagvan wished, 'May the bhaktas see me full of divine light', then that same svarup would be seen as luminous. So, a person who has the nishchay in Bhagvan realises, 'The divya powers, riches, and parshads of the dhams of Golok, Vaikunth, Shvet-Dvip, and Brahmpur, all accompany Bhagvan. Also, the bhaktas who serve Him include Radhika and Lakshmi'. He sees Bhagvan in such a glorious way. However, those who are fools see Him as a human. Shree Krishna Bhagvan has also mentioned in the Geeta: avajananti mam moodha manusheem tanum-ashritam param bhavam-ajananto mama bhoota-maheshvaram : Fools describe me as having a human svarup, but they do not realise my magnificent svarup as the great lord of all beings." Therefore, those who are fools fail to realise such greatness of Bhagvan; instead, they perceive human traits in Bhagvan, seeing Him as a human like themselves.
18.13 "What is meant by perceiving human characteristics? Well, it is when all the feelings of the antah-karans, like kam, krodh, lobh, moh, mad, matsar, asha, trushna; and all the characteristics of the physical body, like bones, skin, faeces, and urine; as well as birth, childhood, youth, old age, and death; and all other human characteristics may appear to have a nishchay in Bhagvan, but his nishchay is flawed. As a result, he will surely fall from satsang.
18.14 "That Bhagvan's svarup is supremely divya – there is not even the slightest trace of human characteristics in Bhagvan, and a person should instead not perceive human traits in Bhagvan, and he should instead initially view Him as a dev; then he should view Him as Brahma; then as Pradhan- Purush; then as Prakruti- Purush; then as Akshar; and finally as Purushottam. For example, upon seeing the incredible charitras of Shree Krishna Bhagvan, the cow-herds of Vraj initially viewed Him as a dev. Then, after listening to the words of Garg-acharya, they viewed Him as Bhagvan. Then, they said, 'You are Bhagvan. So, show us your dham'. They were then shown Akshardham. A person who believes Bhagvan to be divya in this way should be known to have to complete nishchay.
18.15 "Sometimes people say, 'Initially, this person did not have the nishchay in Bhagvan, but now he does'. Does that mean that he did not see Bhagvan initially? Well, he certainly did see Him, but he perceived human characteristics in Him. Later, after he develops nishchay, he does darshan believing Bhagvan to be completely divya; that is known as having developed the nishchay in Bhagvan. Moreover, if a person does not believe Bhagvan to be completely divya, then he repeatedly becomes upset and constantly perceives gun and avgun. He thinks, 'Bhagvan is favouring that person, but not me', or 'He often calls that person, but not me', or 'He has more love for that person, and less for me'. In this way, he continues perceiving gun and avgun. As a result, his heart becomes more and more miserable day by day, and ultimately he falls from satsang. Therefore, a person should certainly not perceive human characteristics in Bhagvan.
18.16 "A person should not perceive avgun even in the bhaktas of Bhagvan. This is because physically a bhakta may be blind, disabled, deaf, old, unattractive, or he may have leukoderma; but when he dies, does he still remain blind or disabled in the dham of Bhagvan? Certainly not. Those are all features of humans. After leaving these features behind, he assumes a divya svarup and becomes brahm-rup. Therefore, if a person should not perceive avgun in the bhaktas of Bhagvan, then how can he possibly perceive them in Bhagvan?
18.17 "Regardless of whether you understand this fact today or you understand it after a hundred years, it must be understood. In actual fact, there is no alternative but to understand it and remember it firmly. Therefore, all bhaktas should remember this principle of mine and discuss it amongst each other. Furthermore, whenever someone suffers a setback due to some misunderstanding, he should be alerted by mentioning this. A person should discuss this principle of mine regularly, at least once a day – this is my agna. So, please do not forget it; please, please, do not forget it!"
18.18 Saying this, Shreeji Maharaj bid "Jay Swaminarayan" to all the bhaktas and returned to His residence smiling. After listening to Shreeji Maharaj's talk, all the sadhu s and bhaktas realised Shreeji Maharaj is the cause of all avatars, the 'avatari', and greatly strengthened their nishchay in Him as being completely divya.

Panchala – 1
The Happiness Of Akshardham
1.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Fagan sud 4 [3rd March 1821], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed on a platform in Jhina-Bhai's darbar in Panchala. He was wearing a white angarkhu and a white khes. He had tied a white feto around His head, with its end hanging on the right side. He had also covered Himself with a thin, white pachhedi. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
1.2 Then, after the sandhya arti, Shreeji Maharaj sat on a large, cylindrical pillow and said, "I wish to ask a question to all these senior paramhans and senior bhaktas: A person may have love for Bhagvan, and also the determination to follow dharma. However, if he has not applied a thought process, then the extremely attractive vishays ( shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh) will never be considered equivalent to the extremely repulsive vishays; nor will they be considered inferior to them. So, which thought must be applied so that the extremely attractive vishays seem equivalent to or inferior to the extremely repulsive vishays? I ask this question to all the senior bhaktas. Whoever has, through whichever thought, realised the attractive vishays to be like the repulsive vishays, or has realised them to be far more repulsive than even the repulsive vishays, please reveal your thoughts."
1.3 Then, all the paramhans and all the bhaktas disclosed their thoughts.
1.4 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Having heard your thoughts, I shall now tell you about the thought which I have maintained. Consider the following example: If someone sends a letter from a distant land, the intelligence of the writer of that letter can be revealed by reading the letter. Now, the appearance and style of speech of the five Pandavs, Draupadi, Kuntaji, Rukmani, Satyabhama, Jambavati, and other queens of Bhagvan, of Bhagvan's son, Samb, and of other bhaktas, are written in the shastras. By hearing those shastras, the description of their appearance allows us to visualise them as if having direct darshan. Also, their intelligence can be revealed from the words of the shastras. In the same way, a person hears from the Purans, the Mahabharat, and other shastras that Bhagvan is the all-doer – is responsible for the creation, sustenance, and destruction of this universe – and that He eternally has a svarup. If He did not have a svarup, He could not be called the all-doer. Furthermore, Akshar-Brahm is the dham in which Bhagvan resides. It is that Bhagvan who has a divya murti; who is luminous and blissful; and who, at the time of creation, gives a buddhi, indriyas, a man, and prans to the jeev s that had been merged in Maya along with their karan bodies at the time of destruction. Why does He give these to the jeev s? He does so to enable them to indulge in the uttam, madhyam, and kanishth types of vishays as well as for the purpose of attaining moksh.
1.5 "Bhagvan has created enjoyments and places of enjoyment for the sake of those jeev s; but within that, the creation of the uttam vishays are for the purpose of reducing the miseries of the inferior vishays. For example, a wealthy merchant may have had trees planted on both sides of a road to provide shade; he may have had water-houses constructed; he may have also had charity-houses and guest-homes constructed. He does all of this for the poor. Similarly, before Bhagvan, Brahma, Shiv, Indra, and other devs are as poor as those paupers of Samvat 1847 who boiled the fruits of pipal trees and then ate them. It is Bhagvan who has created those uttam vishays for the happiness of Brahma and the other devs, and for humans. Also, since the rich merchant builds facilities for the sake of the poor, it is obvious that compared to those, the luxuries in the merchant's own home must be far greater. Similarly, Bhagvan has created happiness for Brahma and others; so it is obvious to an intelligent person that compared to those, the bliss of His own dham must be far more superior. An intelligent person can then conclude that there is an extreme amount of bliss in the dham of Bhagvan. As a result, the attractive vishays become repulsive for him.
1.6 "Furthermore, all the happiness related to vishays which is apparent in this world, be it for animals, humans, devs, or ghosts, is only due to some relation with Bhagvan, and when the happiness is coupled with dharma. However, the bliss that is in Bhagvan Himself cannot be found anywhere else. Consider the following example: The light from this burning torch which falls a short distance away is not as intense as the light in the vicinity of the torch. Very far away, there is not light at all. In the same way, elsewhere there is only a little bliss, but absolute bliss is only available in the vicinity of Bhagvan. The further a person is distanced from Bhagvan, the less bliss he experiences. Therefore, a person who is a mumukshu realises, 'The further away I am from Bhagvan, the more miseries I will face, and ultimately I will become extremely miserable. On the other hand, even the slightest association with Bhagvan will provide immense bliss. I shall experience the highest form of bliss'. A person who thinks in this way, keeps a desire for the bliss of Bhagvan, and employs any means to maintain very close association with Bhagvan, can be called intelligent.
1.7 "Moreover, the happiness of humans exceeds the happiness of animals; and the happiness of a king exceeds that; and the happiness of Indra exceeds that; then Bruhaspati's happiness, then Brahma's, then Vaikunth's. Beyond that, the happiness of Golok is superior, and finally, the bliss of Bhagvan's Akshardham is far more superior.
1.8 "In this way, realising the intensity of the bliss of Bhagvan, a person who is intelligent realises all other pleasures related to vishays to be insignificant. Compared to the bliss of Bhagvan, the pleasures of others are like that of a poor man who begs with a clay pot at the door of a rich grahastha. When I think of the bliss of the dham of that Bhagvan, I become uninterested in all other forms of happiness, and I feel, 'When will I leave this body to experience that bliss?' Moreover, when I naturally indulge in the panch- vishays, I think about no particular thought; but, if I were to sense some pleasure in an object, my thoughts would immediately be diverted to the bliss of Bhagvan, and my mind would become extremely uninterested.
1.9 "These thoughts can only be fully realised by a person who is intelligent. In fact, I have love towards a person who is intelligent. This is because I myself am intelligent, as is my thought process. Moreover, a person who is intelligent will also think similarly. In this way, it appears to me that my thought is superior to all of your thoughts; therefore, all of you should firmly remember this thought of mine in your hearts. Without applying this thought, if a person's vrutti does become attached to appealing vishays, it will only just become detached – and only after much effort. However, for a person who has applied this thought, very little effort is involved in withdrawing his vrutti; he can easily realise how worthless the vishays are.
1.10 "This fact can only be understood by a person who has a sharp intelligence, and a craving for higher happiness. For example, a penny is worth more than a cowry-shell, and a rupee is worth more than a penny; a gold coin is more valuable than a rupee, and a chintamani is more valuable than a gold coin. Similarly, wherever there are pleasures of the panch-vishays, the bliss of Bhagvan in His dham is far more superior in comparison. Therefore, this thought only settles in the heart of a person who is intelligent and who thinks in this way. When this thought does firmly settle in the heart, even if he happens to be in a forest, he would feel, 'I am surrounded by countless people and the wealth of the kingdom', and he would not believe himself to be miserable. Conversely, if he were in Indra's lok, he would feel, 'I am sitting in a forest', and he would not be gratified by the pleasures in the lok of Indra. In fact, he would realise those pleasures to be worthless.
1.11 "Therefore, keeping this thought in mind, all of you should decide, 'Now we want to reach only the dham of Bhagvan; we do not want to be tempted by the worthless pleasures of the panch-vishays along the way'. So, please keep this determination in your mind, as what I have told all of you is my principle; please embed it firmly in your lives."

Sankhya And Yog
2.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Fagan sud 7 [10th March, 1821], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed on a platform in Jhina-Bhai's darbar in Panchala. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white pachhedi. He had also tied a white feto around His head. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
2.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please bring the Moksh-Dharma shastras so that we can arrange for a katha on the chapter of Sankhya and the chapter of Yog." Then, the shastras were brought to the sabha, and Nityanand Swami commenced the reading.
2.3 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "The followers of Yog consider jeev and ishvar to be the twenty-fifth tattva, and Paramatma to be the twenty-sixth tattva. On the other hand, followers of Sankhya include jeev and ishvar with the twenty-four tattvas, and consider Paramatma to be the twenty-fifth tattva. Of the two, the followers of Yog believe thatregardless of however much a person thinks of the atma and non-atma, or however much effort he makes, without accepting the refuge of pratyaks ha Bhagvan, he cannot attain moksh. On the other hand, followers of Sankhya believe that if a person understands the ultimate fate of all devs and humans, develops vairagya for the vishays, and realises his atma as greater than the three bodies ( sthul, sukshma, karan), then he becomes a mukta. However, since each of these two types of beliefs has their own deficiencies, a person should employ certain methods of understanding for the purpose of resolving those deficiencies.
2.4 "The flaw of the Yog philosophy is that both the jeev and ishvar have been considered as the twenty-fifth tattva and both have been said to have bodies comprised of twenty-four tattvas. As a result, both the jeev and ishvar seem equal. This would suggest that the sthul body is the same as virat, the sukshma body is the same as sutratma, and the karan body is the same as avyakrut. It also suggests that the jagrat state is the same as that of sustenance, the svapna state is the same as that of creation, and the sushupti state is the same as that of destruction. Moreover, vishva, taijas, and pragna, would be considered equal to Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiv respectively. As a result, those followers would worship the twenty-sixth tattva with such understanding.
2.5 "To remove this deficiency of equating jeev and ishvar, a person should learn the following method of interpretation from a wise person: The five bhuts residing in the body of ishvar are known as maha-bhuts, and those bhuts sustain the bodies of all jeev s. On the other hand, the five bhuts in the body of the jeev are minor and are incapable of sustaining others. Also, the jeev possesses limited knowledge compared to ishvar, who is all-knowing. A person should learn such a method of interpretation so that the jeev and ishvar are not understood to be equal to each other. If a person has not done that and some opponent were to ask a question in a debate, then he would find it difficult to reply. As a result, his own understanding would become confused. But, if he has learnt such a method, then even if someone were to raise a question, he would not allow the jeev and ishvar to be considered as being equal. Also, he should only listen to words that strengthen this belief.
2.6 "Next, the flaw of the followers of the Sankhya philosophy is that they consider Paramatma to be the twenty-fifth tattva, who is greater than the twenty-four tattvas. They consider the twenty-four tattvas as being false and Paramatma as being satya. If that were so, who would attain that Paramatma? After all, the jeev, who is the achiever, is not considered distinct from the tattvas.
2.7 "To remove that deficiency, a person should learn the following method of interpretation from a wise person: Jeev and ishvar have been included with the tattvas because those twenty-four tattvas cannot exist without the jeev and ishvar. But, in reality, jeev and ishvar are distinct from those tattvas, and do attain Paramatma. A person should learn such a method of interpretation. If he has not done so, and an opponent in a debate were to ask a question, doubts would arise, and he would think, 'If the tattvas are truly false, then what is the purpose of prescribing the observance of dharma, such as brahm-charya, and spiritual activities such as shravan, manan, and nididhyas, to attain Paramatma?' Therefore, jeev and ishvar have been included with the tattvas because they have attained oneness with the tattvas; however, they are totally distinct from those tattvas and do attain Paramatma. In this way, followers of the Sankhya philosophy should learn such methods of interpretation from a wise sadhu.
2.8 "Moreover, the followers of Yog propose the following methods: Moksh is attained by performing dhyan on the pratyaksha murti s of the avatars of Bhagvan such as Matsya, Kurma, Varah, Nrusinh, Vaman, Ram, and Krishna. However, the followers of Sankhya accept methods which claim that moksh is attained when a person fully realises the svarup of Bhagvan, through experience, as described by the various Shruti shastras: yato vacho nivartante aprapya manasa saha : From where speech returns along with the mind without having attained Bhagvan. "Both philosophies are good and have been accepted by the great, and a person who follows both of them appropriately does attain Akshardham. In both of these philosophies, the same spiritual activities have been prescribed, but the method of worship in each is not the same; in fact, it is extremely different."
2.9 Having spoken in this way, Shreeji Maharaj then told the paramhans, "Now please sing kirtans."
2.10 Then, Muktanand Swami and some other paramhans began singing kirtans to the accompaniment of musical instruments. Following this, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Now, please stop the kirtans. While you were singing, I thought over the philosophies of both Sankhya and Yog. Please listen as I explain.
2.11 "For a person who follows Yog, the luminous, divya svarup murti of Bhagvan which resides in Akshardham at the time of atyantik- pralay is worthy of performing dhyan upon. Moreover, Bhagvan in the form of Prakruti- Purush is also worthy of performing dhyan upon, but to a lesser extent. To a lesser extent than that, Bhagvan in the form of the twenty-four tattvas, which have evolved from Prakruti- Purush, is also worthy of performing dhyan upon. To a lesser extent than that, Hiranyagarbh; and to a lesser extent than that, Virat – who has evolved from the twenty-four tattvas – is also worthy of performing dhyan upon. Still to a lesser extent than that, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiv, as well as the avatars of Bhagvan on this earth, such as Matsya, Kurma, Nrusinh, and Varah, as well as shaligram and other murti's of Bhagvan – are all worthy of performing dhyan upon. While I was thinking, I realised that this is the essence of the philosophy of Yog.
2.12 "Then, I thought over the Sankhya philosophy. They have done away with all those svarups, and it appears that they believe, 'The cause of all thoughts is the jeev, and since there is nothing as pure as the jeev, it is appropriate to perform dhyan upon the jeev'. In order to disprove this view of Sankhya, I again thought of Yog. Specifically, Purushottam Bhagvan, who is greater than everything, has an anvay relationship with Prakruti and Purush and all other entities. Therefore, they are all Bhagvan; all possess a divya svarup; all are satya and worthy of performing dhyan upon. Certain Vedic shloks also support this fact: sarvam khalvidam brahma : The whole universe is brahm, the svarup of Bhagvan. neha nanasti kinchana : There is nothing in this universe that is not the svarup of Bhagvan. idam hi vishvam bhagavan-ivetaro yato jagat-sthana-nirodha-sambhavaha : This universe is as another svarup of Bhagvan – who is the cause of the creation, sustenance, and destruction of the world.
2.13 "Therefore, a mumukshu who follows the path of Yog encounters no obstacles. This is because that path is easy and relies on the pratyaksha murti of Bhagvan. For this reason, through that path, even an ordinary person can attain kalyan without any difficulty.
2.14 "However, there is one flaw on that path: Entities, such as Prakruti and Purush, are thought of as being the components of Purushottam Bhagvan. This could cause the following belief to develop: Prakruti and Purush are components of Bhagvan, and their components are Hiranyagarbh and Virat. If such an understanding develops, then that is a major flaw since a person feels Bhagvan is divisible and has components. However, Bhagvan is indivisible, without components, unchanging, imperishable, and whole. Therefore, such a misunderstanding should not be allowed to arise.
2.15 "Also, a person should understand, 'Bhagvan is one and unparalleled, while others, such as Prakruti and Purush, are His bhaktas and perform dhyan upon Him. That is why they are referred to as svarups of Bhagvan. Just as a great sadhu who performs dhyan upon Bhagvan is known as a svarup of Bhagvan, in the same way Prakruti and Purush are also svarups of Bhagvan. Moreover, Purushottam Shree Krishna, who is greater than everything, Himself assumes the forms of Vasudev, Sankarshan, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha, and assumes avatars such as Ram and Krishna. Therefore, He is worthy of performing dhyan upon'. If a person has such an understanding, then that path of Yog is absolutely free of obstacles and is the best path.
2.16 "Now, the flaw of the Sankhya philosophy is that it claims, 'All that is grasped via the antah-karans and the indriyas is false, while all that is grasped through experience is satya'. Therefore, they propose all svarups as being false. Along with that, they also consider the svarups of Bhagvan that have incarnated for the kalyan of the jeev s, as being false. In fact, they also view the svarups of Aniruddha, Pradyumna, and Sankarshan as being false. They only accept Vasudev, who is nirgun. That is their major flaw.
2.17 "Therefore, it suits the followers of Sankhya to believe, 'After absorbing the thoughts of Sankhya and considering whatever has evolved from Prakruti and Purush as being perishable, a person should realise his own atma as being distinct from all, as being pure, and brahm-rup. Then, understanding the svarup of Bhagvan that has incarnated for the kalyan of the jeevs as being satya, he should perform dhyan upon Him'. In this way, these two types of thoughts can be known if a person learns from someone who is wise, like myself; otherwise, even if a person studies or listens to the shastras, he cannot understand them.
2.18 "In reality, the teachings of Yog are actually for a person who has become brahm-rup by initially having practiced thoughts of Sankhya.Therefore, it is said: brahma-bhutaha prasannatma na shochati na kankshati samaha sarveshu bhuteshu mad-bhaktim labhate param : A person who has become brahm-rup remains joyful, grieves nothing, desires nothing, behaves equally with all beings, and attains my supreme bhakti. atmaramash-cha munayo nirgrantha apyurukrame kurvantya-haitukeem bhakti-mittham-bhuta-guno hariha : Despite being engaged only in the atma, and despite having overcome all improper natures – the munis still offer selfless bhakti to Bhagvan, as Bhagvan possesses such divya qualities. parinishthitopi nairgunya uttam-shloka-leelaya gruheeta-cheta rajarshe akhyanam yad-adheetavan : O King (Parikshit)! Despite being perfectly poised in the nirgun state, having been attracted by the leelas of Bhagvan, I (Shukdevji) studied the Shreemad Bhagvat.
2.19 "In this way, the Sankhya philosophy is dependent on Yog. This is because through that Sankhya philosophy, the followers of Sankhya realise all vishays that can be indulged in via the five indriyas and four antah-karans – which are distinct from a person's own atma – to be totally worthless. Therefore, such a person is not tempted by any objects, nor does he become attached to them. Moreover, if someone were to say to him, 'This object is extremely pleasurable', he would think, 'It may be pleasurable, but it is perceived through the indriyas and antah-karans; and that which the indriyas and antah-karans perceive is asatya and perishable'. This is the firm understanding of a follower of Sankhya, who also realises his own atma as pure. Such a person should perform dhyan, upasana, and offer bhakti to Bhagvan according to the path of Yog. If he does not adopt this, that would be a major flaw in him.
2.20 "In this way, I have described the eternal philosophies of the Sankhya shastras and the Yog shastras having thoroughly thought about them. However, the followers of Yog and Sankhya have corrupted both paths. Those who are followers of Yog try to establish the truth of svarups, and in the process they realise all people, the svarups of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiv, as well as svarups of Ram, Krishna, and other avatars as equal to each other. Followers of Sankhya criticise all svarups, and in the process they also criticise places of pilgrimage, vrat, murti s, yam and niyam, forms of dharma such as brahm-charya, as well as Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiv, and Ram, Krishna, and other avatars. Therefore, both the followers of Sankhya and the followers of Yog have deviated from the correct path. As a result, they will be sent to Narak."

Panchala – 3
Intelligence Is Instrumental In Attaining Kalyan - Love Is Maya
3.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Fagan sud 8 [11th March, 1821], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in Jhina-Bhai's darbar in Panchala. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white pachhedi. He had also tied a white feto around His head. A sabha of paramhans, as well as a sabha of haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
3.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said to the paramhans, "Please begin a question-answer discussion."
3.3 Then, Muni Bava asked Brahmanand Swami, "We have attained this satsang, as well as the association of Bhagvan. All other flaws have been eradicated, and we also have enthusiasm to do satsang. Despite this, why do man and irshya still remain?"
3.4 Brahmanand Swami then began to supply an answer, but was unable to do so satisfactorily.
3.5 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Such a person lacks intelligence. This is because a person who is intelligent realises all of his gun and avgun, as well as the gun and avgun of others. On the other hand, a person who is not intelligent only acknowledges his own gun, but fails to realise his avgun; he feels himself to be as distinguished as the Sanakadik, and he views other renowned people to be inferior to himself. However, a person who is intelligent realises his own avgun, and thinks 'I possess many avgun. Then, maintaining an intense hatred towards those avgun, he eradicates them. Also, if a sadhu were to speak to him about eradicating those avgun, he would accept that advice as beneficial. As a result, avgun, such as man and irshya, will not remain in him.
3.6 "On the other hand, someone may appear to be very intelligent, but if he does not recognise his own flaws, then his intelligence should be known to be merely worldly. Outwardly, that intelligence appears to be very sharp, but he cannot be called intelligent. Actually, he should be known to be an utter fool, and his intelligence is useless for attaining his own moksh. In comparison, someone else may possess only a little intelligence, but if he attempts to eradicate his avgun after recognising them, then even his limited intelligence is useful in attaining moksh. In fact, only he can be called intelligent. Therefore, a person who never perceives his own avgun and perceives only his own gun should be known as a fool; and a person who acknowledges his own avgun should be known to be intelligent."
3.7 Then, Shreeji Maharaj instructed, "Now, please sing kirtans." The paramhans then commenced singing 'Sakhi aj Mohan Deetha Re, Sheriye avta Re…'. "
3.8 Following this, Shreeji Maharaj spoke again, "Now, please stop the singing. The kirtans that you have just sung are full of love. While you were singing, I thought about the nature of love, and realised that love is a great quality; and to worship Bhagvan with love is admirable. After deep thought, I realised, 'Love itself is the maya of Bhagvan'. This is because if two women are casually talking to each other, looking at each other, or casually touching each other, then that is a different type of love. Or, if two men are talking to each other, looking at each other, or casually touching each other, then that is also a different type of love. However, if a man is looking at a woman, embracing her, listening to her talks, and enjoying her fragrance, then the love and mental attraction he develops for her is a type of love that does not develop between two men. Also, if a woman is looking at a man and embracing him, then the love she develops for him through his association, with her mind being totally attracted towards him, is a type of love that does not develop between two women. Therefore, that which is the cause of the continuance of the world, and the cause of bondage and the cycle of births and deaths, is the maya of Bhagvan, which takes the form of love.
3.9 "Then, I thought, 'Shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh are the panch-vishays. After having regarded everything else as perishable, if those vishays are directed only towards Bhagvan, realising Him to be the only source of ultimate bliss, then that is fine – that is not maya'. But, then I thought that even that is not appropriate. After all, if a person perceives shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh, to be better in other objects compared to those that are in Bhagvan, he will abandon Bhagvan and will develop love for other objects. For example, Shree Krishna Bhagvan's 16,100 wives, who were apsaras in past lives, had asked for the following vardan from Brahma: 'O Maharaj! We have experienced the touch of devs, demons, and humans, but we have not experienced the touch of Bhagvan as our husband. Therefore, please grace us so that He becomes our husband'. So, Brahma replied, 'Perform tap and Bhagvan will become your husband'. So, they performed intense tap, after which Ashtavakra Rushi and Narad Muni both became pleased and granted the following vardan: 'Bhagvan will become your husband'. In this way, by performing many tap in other lives, they attained Shree Krishna Bhagvan. However, on perceiving more beauty in Samb than in Bhagvan, they became infatuated by Samb. Therefore, it is not appropriate for a person whose mind is not steady to develop love for Bhagvan through the pleasures of the vishays of the five indriyas. However, if a person's mind does remain steady, without having any doubts, then it is appropriate.
3.10 "Moreover, a person who is intelligent should develop love for Bhagvan in the following way: A person should realise his jeev as being distinct from the twenty-four tattvas. Then, after uprooting the vruttis of the five indriyas that are firmly embedded in the jeev, and while remaining as the jeev alone (without vruttis of the indriyas) he should remain nirgun and develop as much love for Bhagvan as possible.
3.11 "What do I mean by nirgun? Well, the ten indriyas are the products of rajo-gun; the antah-karans and their presiding devs are the products of sattva-gun; and the five bhuts and the panch-vishays are the products of tamo-gun. A person who believes himself to be distinct from the products of those three gun and from the three gun themselves, and remains as the jeev alone, is known as nirgun. So, he should become nirgun in this way and develop love of Bhagvan. Therefore, it is said: nairgunyastha ramante sma gunanu-kathane hareha : Although the munis had attained the nirgun state, they still engaged themselves in praising the glory of Bhagvan. parinishthitopi nairgunya uttam-shloka-leelaya gruheeta-cheta rajarshe akhyanam yad-adheetavan : O King (Parikshit)! Despite being perfectly poised in the nirgun state, having been attracted by the leelas of Bhagvan, I (Shukdevji) studied the Shreemad Bhagvat.
3.12 "Those who possess gnan after having realised the nature of the kshetra and the kshetragna attain atma-nishtha and develop love for Bhagvan. What is the kshetra? Well, the three bodies ( sthul, sukshma, and karan) and the three mental states ( jagrat, svapna, and sushupti), are the kshetra. Such a person realises the kshetra to be distinct from his own atma, and he feels, 'Those can never be any part of me; I am the knower; I am extremely pure, formless, genderless, and chetan, while the kshetra is extremely impure, jad, and perishable'. Understanding this firmly, a person who develops vairagya towards everything else, and offers bhakti to Bhagvan while following svadharma, is known to possess ekantik bhakti and gnan. A bhakta possessing this gnan is superior to all. In fact, Bhagvan has said: tesham gnanee nitya-yukta eka-bhaktir-vishishyate priyo hi gnanino tyartha-maham sa cha mama priyaha : Of these – a person who is distressed from having fallen from the path of attaining siddh-dasha, and therefore still wishes to attain them; a person who seeks knowledge of the atma; a person who desires material objects, material pleasures and powers; and a person who has gnan – the person with gnan is the best, as he is always engaged in me and is devoted to me alone. I am exceedingly dear to a person with gnan, and he is dear to me. udaraha sarva evaite gnanee tvatmaiva me matam  : They are all noble, but I consider the one with gnan to be my very atma.
3.13 "Realising this, a person should uproot the indriyas, the antah-karans, and the vishays from the jeev, and develop love for Bhagvan – only that is appropriate. As long as a person has not uprooted them, he should extract work from them in the form of the darshan or touch of Bhagvan. Moreover, they should not be regarded as supporters; instead, they should be regarded as enemies. In fact, a person should never feel gratitude towards them by thinking, 'They are beneficial to me in offering bhakti to Bhagvan'. He should not feel that the eyes enable a person to listen to the katha of Bhagvan; the skin enables a person to experience the touch of Bhagvan; the nose enables a person to experience the fragrance of Bhagvan's mala and tulsi; the mouth enables a person to engage in kathas and sing kirtans in praise of Bhagvan; and the tongue enables a person to experience the taste of Bhagvan's prasad. A person should not understand them to be helpful in performing bhakti of Bhagvan. They should not be given gratitude, nor should they be trusted. Instead, they should be regarded only as enemies. This is because what if in the process of experiencing happiness through the darshan or touch of Bhagvan, they lure a person to believe that there is pleasure in the darshan or touch of women and other objects? That would be very damaging. Therefore, those enemies (the five indriyas) should be confined, and work in the form of bhakti to Bhagvan should be extracted from them. For example, a king who has captured his enemy keeps him chained and extracts work from him; never does the king free him or trust him. If he were to free him or trust him, then the enemy would definitely kill the king. In the same way, if a person trusts his enemies (the indriyas), and frees them and does not keep them confined, they will definitely make him fall from the path of Bhagvan. Therefore, they should never be trusted.
3.14 "Also, just as the British arrest a criminal and keep him standing in a witness box to question him, without freeing him or trusting him, in the same way, the indriyas and the antah-karans should be kept in a witness box and in chains (the niyams of the panch- vartman), and then they should be made to offer bhakti to Bhagvan. However, they should not be given any gratitude; they should be looked upon only as enemies. If the indriyas and the antah-karans are regarded as supporters, given gratitude, and seen to be useful in bhakti, then in the process of experiencing the happiness of the darshan or touch of Bhagvan, they will lure a person to believe that there is some pleasure in women and other objects. As a result, all efforts he has made will become useless. For example, if one spark of fire were to fall on a large pile of gunpowder, then that gunpowder would be completely reduced to ashes. In this way, the stability of a person's indriyas is not certain.
3.15 "Therefore, it is only appropriate that a person develops love for Bhagvan while behaving as the atma. That is my principle, and a person who develops love for Bhagvan in this way is dear to me. Moreover, he should think, 'The beauty of Bhagvan cannot be found anywhere else; the touch of Bhagvan cannot be found anywhere else; the bliss experienced from hearing Bhagvan cannot be found anywhere else; and the tastes related to Bhagvan cannot be found anywhere else'. In this way, a person should tempt the indriyas and the antah-karans, and divert them away from other vishays. This understanding is appropriate."
3.16 Then, Svayamprakashanand Swami said, "Maharaj, in which place should a person stay and develop all these thoughts?"
3.17 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person should think: 'I am not the sthul body, the sukshma body, or the karan body; I do not have the jagrat, svapna, or sushupti states; I am not the five gnan-indriyas, the five karma-indriyas, the four antah-karans or their presiding devs; in fact, I am distinct from all these. I am chaitanya; I am a bhakta of Bhagvan'. If the indriyas and antah-karans misbehave in some way, they should be disciplined in the following way: 'Do you wish to see the beauty only of Bhagvan, or do you also wish to see the beauty of others? Do you wish to listen to sounds related only to Bhagvan and experience smells related to Him, or do you also wish to listen to other sounds and experience other smells? If you do crave after the vishays leaving Bhagvan aside, then what is there between you and me? Who are you and who am I? I will have absolutely nothing to do with you. Whatever you do, you will have to bear the consequences'.
3.18 "Lecturing the indriyas and antah-karans in this way, a person should pray to Bhagvan: 'O Maharaj! O Swami! You intensely love your bhaktas! You are an ocean of mercy! The fault lies with the indriyas and antah-karans. I am distinct from them. In fact, they are my enemies. So, please protect me from their influence'. A person should constantly offer prayers in this way; and understanding his own kshetragna to be composed of chaitanya, he should offer love and bhakti to Bhagvan."

Panchala – 4
Perceiving Divinity In The Human Traits Of Bhagvan
4.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Fagan vad 3 [21st March, 1821], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed on a platform in Jhina-Bhai's darbar in Panchala. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white pachhedi. He had also tied a white feto around His head. In addition to this, He was turning a mala of tulsi beads in His hand. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, was gathered before Him.
4.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said to the paramhans, "Please begin a question-answer discussion amongst yourselves."
4.3 Then, Muni Bava asked a question to Brahmanand Swami, "Initially, a person may have the belief of Bhagvan and may engage in bhajan and smaran; but later, on seeing the human-like actions of Bhagvan, doubts arise in that belief. What is the cause of this?"
4.4 Brahmanand Swami then began to answer that question but was unable to do so satisfactorily.
4.5 Then, having thought for some time, Shreeji Maharaj spoke, "I shall answer that question." Continuing, He said, "The Veds, the Purans, the Mahabharat, the Smrutis, and the other shastras state that the original svarup of Bhagvan, which is eternal, without a beginning, and divya, resides in His Akshardham. They also mention what that Bhagvan is like. His svarup is not like any svarup that can be seen by the eyes; His sound is not like any sound that can be heard by the ears; His touch is not like any touch that can be felt by the skin; His smell is not like any smell that can be smelt by the nose; and the tongue cannot describe that Bhagvan. He cannot be imagined by the man; He cannot be thought of by the chitt; He cannot be understood by the buddhi; nor can the ahankar fully claim, 'I am Bhagvan's and Bhagvan is mine'. In this way, Bhagvan remains beyond the reach of the indriyas and the antah-karans.
4.6 "Moreover, the beauty of Bhagvan is such that it cannot be compared to any other object in this brahmand – including everything from Brahma to the smallest blade of grass; His sound is such that it cannot be compared to any other sounds in this brahmand; The smell of Bhagvan is such that it cannot be compared to any other smell in this brahmand; The touch of Bhagvan is such that it cannot be compared to any other touch in this brahmand; The tastes related to Bhagvan are such that they cannot be compared to any other taste in the brahmand; and the dham of Bhagvan is such that it cannot be compared to any other place in this brahmand. Specifically, out of all the various places in the seven dvips and the nine khands, the extremely beautiful places of Brahma and others on Mount Meru, the various places on Mount Loka-Lok, the loks of Indra, Varun, Kuber, Shiv, and Brahma, and many other places, not one of them can compare to the dham of Bhagvan. The bliss experienced by the bhaktas of Bhagvan residing in that dham is such that it cannot be compared to any other type of bliss in this brahmand.
4.7 "The svarup of that Bhagvan is such that it cannot be compared to the svarup of anyone in this brahmand. This is because all the svarups in this brahmand which evolved from Prakruti and Purush are mayik, whereas Bhagvan is divya. So, since the two are totally different, how can they possibly be compared? For example, we can compare a person to something by saying, 'This man is like a buffalo, like a snake, like a sparrow, like a donkey, like a dog, like a crow, or like an elephant'. But in reality, such comparisons are not appropriate for humans. This is because all of those animals are in a completely different group compared to humans. Even between a human and a human, there is no exact similarity where a person can claim, 'This person is exactly like that person'. If he were exactly like the other person, then how could the original person be recognised?
4.8 "Therefore, despite the fact that all humans belong to the same group, no two are exactly alike. Just look at Bhago and Mulo – the two are said to be identical; but, if a person stays with them for a few days, he can distinguish between them and say, 'This is Bhago and this is Mulo'. But, if there were no difference, how could they be recognised? So, if there is no great similarity between that which is mayik and that which is not mayik, what can possibly be compared to Bhagvan and the dham of Bhagvan? After all, all shastras claim, 'Bhagvan is beyond the reach of the indriyas and the antah-karans'.
4.9 "When that Bhagvan does not wish to give His darshan to beings, He stays in this way in His own Akshardham with a divya svarup, and as a result He remains beyond reach. That Bhagvan is the lord of all lords, He is surrounded by countless divya luxuries and countless divya parshads, and He is the lord of countless millions of brahmands.
4.10 "Take the example of a great world-emperor whose kingdom stretches from where the sun rises to where it sets. This emperor, by the strength of his own tap, has attained divine powers like those of the devs, and is ruling over the loks of Svarg, Mrutyu-Lok, and Patal – just like Arjun, who remained on the throne of Indra in Svarg-Lok for many years with his own body, and Nahush Raja, who also became Indra. The emperor is so powerful, that it is not possible to count the villages in his kingdom, as they are innumerable. The chiefs of these villages also cannot be counted, as they are also innumerable. Furthermore, the countless chiefs of those villages come to his darbar to make requests. The emperor's money, property, pleasures, palaces, and wealth are also countless.
4.11 "Just like the emperor, Bhagvan is the king of the kings of countless villages ( brahmands). Moreover, the chiefs of those villages ( brahmands) are Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiv. Just as in one village one chief is senior and the whole population of that village bows before him and follows his agna, and just as the chief in turn bows before the king, similarly, in each brahmand, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiv are senior, and the others in that brahmand, that are the devs, demons, humans, rushis, and prajapatis of that brahmand, worship them and follow their agna. But, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiv in turn worship Purushottam Bhagvan and follow His agna. Furthermore, all the Brahmas, Vishnus, and Shivs of all the brahmands pray to Bhagvan, 'Maharaj! Please have compassion on us and visit our brahmand' – just as the chief of a village requests the world-emperor, 'Maharaj! I am poor. Please visit my house. I shall serve you to the best of my ability'. In the same way, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiv pray to Bhagvan, 'Maharaj! Please have mercy upon us and grace us with your darshan; visit our brahmand'. Only then does Bhagvan assume a body in that brahmand.
4.12 "Moreover, He assumes a body based on the task to be performed there, and He also behaves accordingly. If He assumes the body of a dev, then He behaves exactly like a dev. If He assumes the body of an animal, then He behaves exactly like an animal. For example, when Bhagvan assumed the svarup of Varah, He found the earth by smelling it. When He became Hayagriv, He started to neigh like a horse. When He assumed the bodies of water creatures, such as Matsya and Kurma, He moved only in water, but not on land. When He became the svarup of Nrusinh, He behaved exactly like a lion, not like a human.
4.13 "When that Bhagvan assumes the svarup of a human being, He behaves exactly like a human. During Satya-Yug, the lifespan of humans is one hundred thousand years, so Bhagvan also lives for one hundred thousand years. Also, just as people in Satya-Yug can indulge in any object their mind desires, Bhagvan also indulges in objects in the same way; He does not behave in any extraordinary way. In Treta-Yug, the lifespan of humans is ten thousand years. So, when Bhagvan is born in Treta-Yug, He also lives for ten thousand years. In Dvapar-Yug, the lifespan of humans is one thousand years, and humans possess the strength of ten thousand elephants. So, Bhagvan also possesses the same strength and has the same lifespan. Finally, when Bhagvan is born in Kali-Yug, He assumes the lifespan and strength of humans according to the humans of Kali-Yug.
4.14 "Just as a child is conceived, then develops in the womb, then is born, then undergoes the phases of childhood, youth, and old age, and eventually dies, Bhagvan also undergoes the same process, exactly like a human. Also, just as humans possess svabhav s – such as kam, krodh, lobh, svad, man, sneh, mad, matsar, irshya, moh, asha, trushna, hatred, attachment, infatuation, happiness, misery, fear, fearlessness, bravery, cowardice, hunger, thirst, sleep, prejudice, a feeling that this belongs to others, a feeling that this belongs to me, tyag, vairagya – in the same way, all of those svabhav s are apparent in Bhagvan when He assumes a human body. All the shastras have also described that human svarup of Bhagvan along with His original, divya svarup. A person, who has developed a firm nishchay of both of those svarups through intense shravan and manan, never has any doubts; whereas a person who lacks this type of understanding does have doubts about Bhagvan.
4.15 "When that Bhagvan – who possesses a divya svarup – assumes a human body, He behaves with svabhavs similar to humans. However, an intelligent person realises, 'He possesses kam, but it is not like that of other humans. In fact, krodh, lobh, svad, man, and other human svabhavs are also present in Bhagvan, but they are certainly not like those possessed by other humans'. An intelligent person also realises that there is something divya about that Bhagvan, and with this understanding, he develops the belief of Him being Bhagvan. For example, Shankar-acharya entered the body of a king in order to gain knowledge of certain affectionate details. Therefore, at that time, his bodily gestures and his emotions were all affectionate like those of the king. However, the queen was intelligent and realised, 'My husband did not possess such powers; therefore, some other jeev has entered his body'. In the same way, divya qualities are apparent in Bhagvan in human svarup. As a result, a person develops the nishchay in Him being Bhagvan.
4.16 "Then you may say, 'If someone develops the nishchay in Bhagvan on noticing something divya, then if He were to display divya qualities, many people would develop the same belief'. However, the fact of the matter is as follows: All the shastras refer to the sun by saying, 'It is Bhagvan'. Moreover, that sun is visible to everyone, and people do its darshan daily. Despite this, no person has ever been convinced of his or her own kalyan as a result of its darshan, and they do not believe, 'I have attained kalyan'. On the other hand, after having the darshan of Ram, Krishna, and the other avatars in human svarup, and of Narad, Shukji, and other sadhu s, people do attain the belief that my kalyan is certainly guaranteed, and I am fulfilled. Even though there is no divine light in that Bhagvan and those sadhu s, and a person can only have their darshan after lighting an oil lamp, he still becomes convinced of his own kalyan.
4.17 "Consider another example: Fire is also a visible svarup of Bhagvan, as Bhagvan has said: aham vaishvanaro bhootva praninam deha-mashritaha pranapana-samayuktaha pachamyanam chaturvirdham : Remaining in the bodies of all being as Vaishvanar (the fire of digestion), I digest the four types of food (chewable, drinkable, lickable, and suckable) with the help of pran vayu (inhaled air) and apan vayu (air that pushes food downwards).
4.18 "The darshan of that fire is available to all, but that does not grant people belief of their own kalyan, whereas with the darshan of Bhagvan and His sadhu, they do gain belief of their own kalyan. The reason for this is that there is a difference between humans, and the sun and fire; as a result, a person is not convinced of his kalyan upon having the darshan of the sun or fire. Instead, if someone touches fire, he will be burnt. Furthermore, when Kuntaji called upon Surya using the mantra given by Durvasa, Surya came to Kuntaji in a human svarup just like Kuntaji's own svarup. As a result, she was able to enjoy his intimacy, and therefore conceived Karna. In actuality, Surya is extremely luminous; and if he had come with all of his light, Kuntaji would have been burnt to death, and she would not have been able to enjoy his intimacy. Also, when Surya used to come to Satrajit Yadav, he came as a human. However, when he came to Kuntaji and came to Satrajit, did he leave his place in the sky? He remained in the sky; but assuming another svarup, that very same Surya came to Kuntaji and Satrajit. Moreover, there was just as much luminosity in that svarup as there is in the sun, but he suppressed that luminosity and came as a human.
4.19 "In the same way, if Bhagvan were to give darshan to beings with all of His divya qualities, then humans would not find it suitable, and they would wonder, 'Is this a ghost, or what?' Therefore, Bhagvan suppresses His own divya powers and gives darshan exactly like a human. But, at the same time, He still remains present in His own dham. Only when Bhagvan comes as a human are people able to do His darshan, touch Him, and offer the nine types of bhakti.
4.20 "If Bhagvan does not become like a human and instead behaves with complete divya qualities, then people would not be able to develop love or feelings of friendship for Him. This is because a human develops love and friendship for another human, and animals develop mutual love and friendship for other animals; but humans and animals do not develop the same love and friendship for each other. Therefore, those belonging to the same group develop love towards each other, but not towards those belonging to a different group.
4.21 "Similarly, Bhagvan suppresses His divya qualities and becomes exactly like a human so that His bhaktas can develop love for Him. He does not exhibit His divya qualities. Exhibiting His divya qualities would place Him in a different group, and as a result, bhaktas would not be able to develop love and friendship towards Him. It is for this reason that when Bhagvan appears in human svarup, He remains extremely cautious to ensure that His divya qualities remain hidden. However, if He were to become a little impatient in some task, His divya qualities would become apparent. Occasionally, by His own wish, He may reveal His divya qualities to some bhakta. For example, as Shree Krishna Bhagvan became impatient to kill Bhishma, He forgot his human-like nature and reverted to His divya powers. As a result, the earth was incapable of bearing the burden. When He revealed His divya qualities to Arjun, it was revealed as a result of His own wish. However, Arjun did not experience bliss due to that divya qualities, and he become very uneasy. Then, when Shree Krishna Bhagvan gave darshan to Arjun in His human svarup, Arjun experienced bliss and said: drusht-vedam manusham rupam tava saumyam janardana idaneem-asmi samvruttaha sachetaha prakrutim gataha : Vanquisher of the evil (Krishna)! Having seen your gentle human svarup, I am now calm and have been restored to my original nature.
4.22 "Therefore, a person only finds it suitable when Bhagvan behaves like a human; otherwise he would not. Yet, when Bhagvan behaves as a human, a person who does not have this understanding would find it difficult to accept His human-like nature. Moreover, if Bhagvan were to behave with only divya qualities, a person would be unable to understand all that is beyond the reach of the mind and speech. For this reason, the shastras have described Bhagvan in both ways. A person who has fully realised Him in this way would not develop any doubts; but, doubts would certainly arise in a person who does not understand in this way.
4.23 "Someone may claim, 'I have realised Bhagvan, and I have nishchay in Bhagvan'. But, if he has not understood this talk, then his nishchay is still imperfect. For example, a person may have learnt a shlok or a kirtan. If he were asked, 'Have you learnt this shlok or kirtan?' he would reply that he has, and he would also be able to recite it. But, if he were to forget that shlok or kirtan after a few days, then it can be said that when he originally learnt the shlok, he had not learnt it properly. This is because that shlok or kirtan was not fully imprinted in his jeev through intense practice, and through shravan and manan. However, if something is learnt in childhood thoroughly, then it can be recalled when required, even during youth or old age. In the same way, when that person attempted to develop the nishchay in Bhagvan, some deficiencies remained. If no deficiencies had remained, and if he had done shravan, manan, and intense repetition in his jeev, then he would never have had any doubts at all."

Pride And Humility
5.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Fagan vad 8 [27th March, 1821], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed on a platform in Jhina-Bhai's darbar in Panchala. He was wearing a white khes and a warm, red dagli. He had also tied a white feto around His head. In addition to this, He had covered Himself with a white chadar. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, has gathered before Him.
5.2 Then, Svayamprakashanand Swami asked a question: "When is pride appropriate, and when is it not appropriate? When is humbleness appropriate, and when is it not appropriate?"
5.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "It is appropriate to have pride before a person who spites satsang, or speaks offensively of Bhagvan or His great sant. If someone does speak offensively, a person should retaliate with words as sharp as an arrow; but in no way should he become humble before a vimukh. In such a situation, that is appropriate. On the other hand, it is not appropriate to have pride before Bhagvan or His sant. Before them, putting pride aside, behaving as a das of a das, and becoming humble, is the only appropriate behaviour."

Those With Firm Upasana Attain Kalyan
6.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on the night of Fagan vad 9 [28th March, 1821], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed on a platform of Jhina-Bhai's darbar in Panchala. He was wearing a warm, red dagli along with a white angarkhu. He had also tied a white feto around His head. In addition to this, He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a thin, white cloth. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
6.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I thought for quite some time, and having mentally skimmed through all the shastras, it has become apparent that there has not been any avatar as powerful as Shree Krishna. This is because Shree Krishna has exhibited the characteristics of all of His other countless svarups within Himself.
6.3 "Firstly, after Devki gave birth to Him, He gave darshan in a four-armed svarup holding a shankh, a chakra, a gada, and a padma, thereby revealing in Himself the characteristics of the husband of Lakshmi, Bhagvan. To His mother Yashoda, He showed the Vishvarup form in His own mouth, which revealed the characteristics of Aniruddha in Himself through His thousand-headed svarup. He gave darshan to Akrur in the river Yamuna, thereby revealing the characteristics of Shesh-Shayi. He showed the Vishvarup form to Arjun on the battlefield: pashya me parth rupani shata-shotha sahastra-shaha : O Son of Prutha (Arjun). Behold my hundreds and thousands of divine svarups." Shree Krishna showed countless brahmands and revealed the characteristics of Purushottam.
6.4 "Moreover, Shree Krishna has said: yasmat-ksharama-teeto-hama-ksharad-api chottamaha atosmi loke vede cha prathitaha Purushottamaha : I am greater than all that is perishable, and I am greater than even the imperishable. Therefore, I am known in the Smrutis and Veds as 'Purushottam'. "In this way, He revealed Himself as Purushottam. Also, He was the Shree Krishna who resides in Golok with Radhika.
6.5 "When Shree Krishna went to retrieve the brahman's son, He gave darshan to Arjun as Bhuma-Purush. It was Vasudev, who resides in Shvet-Dvip who Himself assumed that avatar. Moreover, throughout the Mahabharat and the Shreemad Bhagvat, Nar- Narayan has been referred to as that Shree Krishna Himself. Therefore, the murtis, strength, and divya powers of that same Bhagvan, which reside in that avatar of Shree Krishna in various ways, are complete. Therefore, that avatar was very great. After all, other svarups possessed a few divya powers, whereas Shree Krishna was filled with all divya powers. Therefore, there is no avatar like the avatar of Krishna; that avatar reigns as sarvopari. Only some powers have been revealed through the other avatars. However, this avatar has revealed all divya powers and strengths. Therefore, this avatar is the greatest of all.
6.6 "If a person has a firm belief of the pratyaksha Shree Krishna in this way, and if that belief never changes in any way, then even if he happens to disobey an agna due to the influence of kusang, he would not fall from the path of kalyan; he would certainly attain kalyan. Therefore, if all of you paramhans and haribhaktas also develop such firmness of the upasana of Bhagvan in this way, then even if you happen to slightly disobey an agna, you will still ultimately attain kalyan."
6.7 Hearing this talk, all the sadhu s and haribhaktas realised Shreeji Maharaj as the cause of all, which strengthened their upasana.

Panchala – 7
The ' Maya' Of A Magician
7.1 In the Samvat year 1877, about two-and-a-half hours after sunrise on Fagan vad 11 [29th March, 1821], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed on a platform in Jhina-Bhai's darbar in Panchala. He was wearing a warm, red dagli and a white khes. He had also tied a white feto around His head. In addition to this, He had covered Himself with a white pachhedi. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
7.2 In the sabha, Shreeji Maharaj had Nityanand Swami read a passage from the first skandh of the Shreemad Bhagvat. The first shlok he read was: janmadyasya yatah-nvayad-itaratash-chartheshvabhignaha svarat tene brahma hruda ya adikavaye muhyanti yat-soorayaha tejo-vari-mrudam yatha vinimayo yatra trisargo mrusha dhamna svena sada nirasta-kuhakam satyam param dheemahi
7.3 Then, Shreeji Maharaj Himself began to explain the meaning of the third line of that shlok: "A person should realise that the entities evolved out of the three gun of Maya, which are the five bhuts, the indriyas, the antah-karans, and their presiding devs, are never present in Bhagvan at any time – past, present, or future. Also, a person should interpret the last line as the shlok, as follows: Bhagvan, via His own svarup ( dham), destroyed the deception (the products of maya). This is the supremely satya svarup of Bhagvan. Moreover, just as the svarup of Bhagvan in Akshardham is magnificent with countless divine powers and divine light at the end of atyantik- pralay, a person should realise exactly the same regarding pratyaksha Bhagvan in human svarup. A person who realises this is said to have known Bhagvan perfectly.
7.4 "However, when a foolish person looks at pratyaksha Bhagvan with a mayik vision, he sees a human like himself. Also, just as he himself is born, becomes a child, becomes a youth, becomes old and dies, in the same way, he believes Bhagvan to undergo the same process. But, when he worships Bhagvan with the sincerity, having faith in the words of the ekantik sant of Bhagvan, his mayik vision disappears. Then, a person realises that same svarup of Bhagvan as being the supreme chaitanya, which is sachidanand. The Shreemad Bhagvat also mentions: sa veda dhatuha padaveem parasya duranta-veeryasya rathanga-panehe yo-mayaya santa-tayanu-vruttya bhajeta tat-pada-saroja-gandhama : He who, having become free from maya, serves the holy feet of Bhagvan, will constantly follow His wishes, and attain the state of Bhagvan – who holds a chakra in His hand, has infinite powers, and is the supporter of the universe.
7.5 "The phases of childhood, youth, and old age apparent in Bhagvan, as well as His birth and death, are all seen due to His extraordinary powers of creating an illusion. In reality, Bhagvan remains absolutely unchanged. For example, a skilled magician arms himself with weapons and ascends to the sky to fight against the warriors of the demons – the enemies of Indra. Then, having been cut to pieces, he falls to the ground. Then, the magician's wife gathers those pieces together and burns herself on his funeral pyre. After a short while, the magician appears out of the sky, armed with weapons, exactly as he appeared before. He then asks the king for a reward and requests, 'Please return my wife'. Having seen such an astonishing performance, if a person is unable to comprehend the 'maya' of even a magician, how then can the extraordinary powers of Bhagvan possibly be comprehended? A person who does comprehend that 'maya' of the magician, realises: 'That magician has not died, nor has he been burnt. In reality, he is exactly the same as he was before'. In a similar way, a person who is said to have realised the svarup of Bhagvan perfectly, understands Bhagvan to be eternal and imperishable, and absolutely unchanging. For example, when Shree Krishna Bhagvan left His body, Rukmani and the other wives of Bhagvan took His body and burnt themselves along with Him. At that time, the ignorant people thought, 'Now He is dead'. On the other hand, those who possessed gnan, thought, 'He has disappeared from here and has gone elsewhere'. They understood Bhagvan as being eternal. As a result, Shree Krishna Himself has said: avajananti mam moodha manusheem tanum-ashritam param bhavam-ajananto mama bhoota-maheshvaram : Fools mock me as having a human svarup, but they do not realise my divya svarup as the great lord of all beings.
7.6 "So, if a fool understands Bhagvan as being sakar, then he understands Him as being merely like a human; or he understands Bhagvan as being nirakar so that He is not considered mayik like other mayik svarups. In this way, a fool misunderstands on both accounts.
7.7 "But, if Bhagvan did not have a svarup, then what about the fact that Shrutis have said that during atyantik- pralay, 'sa ikshata', meaning, 'That Bhagvan saw…'. If Bhagvan 'saw', then He had to have a svarup, possessing eyes, ears and other organs. Moreover, it is said: purushenatam-bhootena veeryama-dhatta veeryavana : Purushottam became the svarup of Purush and impregnated Maya. "Therefore, Bhagvan has always had a svarup.
7.8 "Moreover, when that Purushottam Narayan takes the svarup of Purush for some task, that Purush is hidden by the divine light of Purushottam, and only Purushottam remains. In the same way, when Purushottam takes the form of Maya, that Maya is also hidden by the divine light of Purushottam, and only Bhagvan remains in that svarup. Then, Bhagvan takes the svarup of maha-tattva, then the svarups of others evolved from maha-tattva, then the svarup of Virat, then the svarup of Brahma and others created from that Virat- Purush, and then the svarup of Narad and the Sanakadik. In this way, in whomever that Purushottam Bhagvan 'enters' for the purpose of fulfilling many types of tasks, He hides that entity by His own divine light, and He Himself reigns supreme through that entity. Moreover, in whomever He resides, He suppresses their own light and displays His own divine light – just as when fire enters iron, it suppresses the quality of coldness and the black colour of that iron, and exhibits its own quality.
7.9 "Also, when the sun rises, the light from all the stars and the moon, merges into its own light, and only the sun's light remains. In the same way, Bhagvan overpowers the light of whoever He 'enters' and exhibits His own divine light to a greater degree. Then, after completing that task for which He had 'entered' that entity, He separates from the entity; and the entity remains as it was before. Therefore, the additional powers that the entity appeared to have should be known to actually be the power of Purushottam Bhagvan.
7.10 "In this way, the pratyaksha Purushottam Narayan is the cause of all; He is forever divya and is sakar. A person should not perceive any type of imperfections in that murti – it is like a murti made of sakar. Also, he should perform dhyan, bhajan, and offer bhakti only to the murti that he has seen. Furthermore, whichever human traits seem apparent in that Bhagvan should be understood to be like the ' maya' of a magician. A person who has such an understanding does not develop delusion for that Bhagvan in any way.
7.11 "These talks can be understood by a person with the following firm belief: 'Even at the time of atyantik-pralay, Bhagvan and His bhaktas remain in Akshardham, where the bhaktas enjoy divya bliss, having attained a divya murti. Moreover, the murti of that Bhagvan and the svarups of the bhaktas of Bhagvan possess divine light that is equivalent to the light of countless suns and moons'. Only a person with such firm understanding is able to understand these talks.
7.12 "Also, that Bhagvan – who has a luminous and divya murti – becomes like a human out of compassion, to give kalyan to the jeev s and to allow those jeev s to offer the nine types of bhakti to Him; and He always does so with all of His strength, divine powers, and parshads. Even then, those who realise this complex truth understand the human svarup of Bhagvan on this earth as being exactly the same as the svarup of Bhagvan residing in Akshardham – they do not feel that there is even a slight difference between that svarup and this svarup. A person who has known Bhagvan in this way can be said to have known Bhagvan perfectly. For him, maya can be said to have been eradicated. A person who realises this is called a bhakta with gnan and an ekantik bhakta. Moreover, if by chance a person possessing such firm upasana of pratyaksha Bhagvan were to behave inappropriately due to the influence of kusang or due to the influence of his own prarabdha karma s, even then he would attain kalyan. On the other hand, a person who has doubts in realising Bhagvan in this way, even if he is a strict urdhvareta naishtik brahm-chari and a great tyagi, attaining kalyan would still be extremely difficult for him.
7.13 "If a person has, from the beginning, developed a firm belief that Bhagvan is sakar even at the end of atyantik- pralay, and if he were to listen to shastras describing Bhagvan as being merely full of divine light and nirakar, or if he were to hear such talks from someone, even then he would not have doubts. This is because he has realised, 'Bhagvan is eternally sakar and is never nirakar. Furthermore, that very Bhagvan assumes different murtis, such as Ram and Krishna'. A person with such firm understanding should be known to have perfect nishchay."
7.14 In this way, for the purpose of enlightening His bhaktas, Shreeji Maharaj talked about the unparalleled nishchay of His own svarup. On hearing this, all the paramhans and bhaktas strengthened their nishchay in Shreeji Maharaj's svarup as described.

Gadhada II – 1
The Elimination Of Moh
1.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Jyeshth sud Punam [15th June 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a white pagh around His head, and was wearing a garland of white flowers. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the paramhans were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a jhanjh and mrudang.
1.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said to the paramhans who were singing kirtans, "Please stop singing for the time being, and conduct a question-answer discussion."
1.3 Then, Muktanand Swami bowed to Shreeji Maharaj with folded hands and asked, "Maharaj, what is that nature of moh? Also, how can moh be eliminated?"
1.4 After thinking for a short while, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "It seems that a feeling of illusion which often appears in the mind is the very nature of moh. When moh intensifies in a person's heart, the illusion in his mind also intensifies. He then loses all sense of judgment of what should be done and what should not be done.
1.5 "In fact, just today, I was thinking about the reason behind the development of moh. Last night, I awoke in the middle of the night and slept facing north. Upon seeing the Dhruv Star, the following thought arose: 'This is the northern Dhruv, but the shastras also mention a southern Dhruv. Where could that be?' Then, I looked for the southern Dhruv and I saw it as well. Just as there is a pulley for drawing water from a well, I saw a similar large pulley between the two Dhruv stars. The tips of the two supports of the wheel were touching the Dhruv stars, just as wooden pillars are held up by iron rods hammered between them. Also, just as a rope is wound around a rope-wheel which is studded with brass ornaments, similarly, I saw the positions of all the stars, the devs, and the nine planets, arranged around that rope-wheel. I also saw the sun and moon rise and set from the same direction. Then, looking within, I saw that all things that are in the brahmand are also all in the body. I saw the kshetragna that resides in the body. I also saw Purushottam Bhagvan, who resides within that kshetragna. On seeing that Bhagvan, my vrutti became so deeply engrossed in His svarup, that returning out of samadhi seemed impossible. But, a bhakta then came near and prayed to me. It was only out of compassion that I was able to return into this body.
1.6 "Then, the following thought arose in my mind: 'I was able to return from samadhi due to compassion, but what could be the reason for others coming out of samadhi?' It seemed to me that they come out of samadhi because there is still an attachment for some vishays.
1.7 "Therefore, the panch-vishays are the cause of moh. Moreover, there are three levels of those vishays – uttam, madhyam, and kanishth. Of these, if a person who has obtained uttam vishays encounters someone who obstructs him from them, then that person becomes angry with him. From that anger, moh develops.
1.8 "Generally, the ears have a constant relationship with sounds, and the skin has a constant relationship with touch. In this way, the five gnan- indriyas are related to the vishays. Therefore, if a person who has casually seen an object wishes to break his vrutti from that object and keep it focused on the svarup of Bhagvan instead, then no effort is required; his vrutti would become detached quite easily from the vishays and remain on the svarup of Bhagvan. On the other hand, if a person has seen an extremely charming object, such as a woman, and his vrutti has become fixed on that, then even if he attempts to keep this vrutti on Bhagvan's svarup, it will not stay there; and nor will his chitt remain steady. Therefore, as long as the chitt is attracted by charming vishays, moh cannot be eradicated. Moreover, if a sant, or his guru, or his ishta-dev ( Bhagvan) criticises a vishay which has attracted his chitt, he would become upset with them and even insult them; he would not be able to accept their words. Such an experience in a person's heart should be known as moh. In addition, Bhagvan has said in the Geeta: dhyayato vishayan-punsaha sanga-steshu-pajayate sangat-sanjayate kamaha kamat-krodho-bhijayate krodhad-bhavati sammohaha sammohat-smruti-vibhramaha smruti-bhranshad-buddhi-nasho bhudhi-nashat-pranashyati : A person thinking about the sense objects develops attachment toward them. From the attachment, desires develop; from the desires, anger develops; from anger, delusion develops; from delusion, confusion of the mind develops; from confusion of the mind, loss of buddhi develops; and as a result of the loss of buddhi, he perishes." These words spoken by Shree Krishna Bhagvan are universal principles. When the chitt is attracted to vishays, no matter how intelligent a person may be, his buddhi becomes unstable and he becomes like an animal. Therefore, moh is generated due to attachment to the vishays.
1.9 "Now, if a person who wishes to detach his chitt from those vishays, he should firstly strengthen his knowledge of the atma – 'I am the atma, not this body'. Secondly, he should understand the nature of how the universe is created, sustained, and destroyed. Thirdly, he should thoroughly understand the greatness of Bhagvan. He should think, 'The panch-vishays have been created by Bhagvan; therefore, there must be much more bliss in Bhagvan than there is in them. How is that? Well, sounds contain only pleasures related to sounds; the pleasures of the other four types of vishays cannot be found in sounds'. In the same way, only the pleasures of touch and no other vishays can be found in touch. Similarly, only the pleasures of sight exist in sights. The same applies for tastes and smells in that only their own pleasures exist, but the pleasures of all the panch-vishays cannot be experienced in just one vishay.
1.10 "On the other hand, in Bhagvan's svarup, all pleasures exist at the same time. Therefore, even if a bhakta only has darshan, he still feels totally satisfied. Similarly, touch and other types of contact with Bhagvan also make His bhaktas feel totally fulfilled. Also, the worldly pleasures related to vishays are all perishable, whereas the bliss related to Bhagvan is everlasting. Such thoughts of the greatness of Bhagvan should be strengthened. So, attachment to the vishays is eradicated through these three types of thoughts.
1.11 "When attachment to the vishays is eradicated, a person no longer makes distinctions between pleasant and unpleasant vishays – an ugly woman appears the same as a beautiful woman. In the same way, he sees everything – animals, birds, wood, dung, stones, and gold – to be the same; he is not infatuated on seeing a pleasant object. This is how he views the panch-vishays; and no distinctions between pleasantness and unpleasantness remain in his mind. A person who behaves like this is known to be free of moh. Shree Krishna Bhagvan has also mentioned this in the Geeta: sama-loshtashma-kanchanaha : He who regards a lump of earth, a stone, and gold as equal, is said to be gunatit.
1.12 "A person with such characteristics has realised Bhagvan perfectly; and only he can be called an ekantik bhakta. He should be known to have qualities like that of a pati-vrata who abides by the vow of fidelity, and only he should be known to possess gnan. Also, Bhagvan becomes pleased upon him. Such a bhakta is extremely dear to Bhagvan; that is why Bhagvan has said in the Geeta: priyo hi gnanino-tyartha-maham sa cha mama priyaha : I am very dear to a person with gnan, and he is dear to me.
1.13 "So, only such bhaktas of Bhagvan, who have qualities like that of a pati-vrata, are extremely dear to Bhagvan. Moreover, it is not as if such qualities are only acquired by a person who is clever; it is acquired by all those who have an intense desire for them – just like in the world, naïve wives may be faithful, while shrewd wives may be unfaithful. Therefore, it does not matter whether a person is shrewd or naïve; instead, it is those who have an intense desire for kalyan that keep the qualities of a pati-vrata and offer bhakti to Bhagvan.
1.14 "The state in which a person views pleasant and unpleasant vishays as equal and becomes free of moh, cannot be attained in just one day. Such an achievement cannot be accomplished so hastily; only a person who attempts to do so gradually and earnestly accomplishes it. Take the example of a stone placed on the edge of a water-well. Due to the constant drawing of water with a rope, after a long period of time that rope causes a groove to form in the stone, despite the rope being soft. Even if an iron chain were to be used to draw the water, such a groove would still not form immediately. Therefore, those who wish to strive for kalyan should eradicate attachment to the vishays, and they should not become frustrated or upset. This is also mentioned in the Geeta: anek-janma-sansiddh-stato yati param gatim : A yogi who has become siddh after many lives, attains Akshardham.
1.15 "Therefore, a person should think, 'I will eradicate as much attachment to the vishays as is possible in this life, and if in the process, some attachment still remains, then it can be eradicated in a future life. Moreover, since I am a bhakta of Bhagvan, I do not desire to enter the cycle of births and deaths'. In this way, a bhakta should remain courageous and continue to gradually uproot moh.
1.16 "As long as pleasant and unpleasant vishays do not appear to be equal, a bhakta of Bhagvan is said to be in sadhan- dasha. When they do appear to be equal, that bhakta should be known to have attained siddh- dasha. When a person abandons his attachment to vishays and attains siddh- dasha, he should be known to have become fulfilled. This is the very essence of all the shastras. Furthermore, this talk which I have delivered before you is the fundamental principle of all the shastras. Therefore, all bhaktas should firmly remember it in their lives."

Gadhada II – 2
Overcoming The Panch-Vishays
2.1 In the Samvat year 1877, on Shravan sud 3 [1st August 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a silken, square cushion in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the munis were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a jhanjh and mrudang.
2.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please stop singing as I wish to speak to you." Shreeji Maharaj continued, "A person who wishes to attain ultimate kalyan and hopes to become a sadhu like Narad and the Sanakadik, should think, 'The jeev resides in the body; and the indriyas and antah-karans have attached themselves to that jeev'. They have also attached themselves externally to the panch-vishays. However, due to ignorance, the jeev believes those indriyas, and the antah-karans to be its own form, whereas in actual fact, it is distinct from them. The vishays are also distinct from the antah-karans, but because of constant association with them, they appear to have become one with the antah-karans.
2.3 "In fact, the desire to indulge in the vishays actually arises because of the indriyas, not because of the antah-karans. For example, extreme heat or cold first comes into contact with the outer indriyas, and then enters the body via those indriyas. In other words, it is not generated from within; it is generated outside and then enters within. In the same way, desires for the panch-vishays are not initially generated in the antah-karans; the indriyas first come into contact with the vishays externally, and then those vishays enter the antah-karans. To give another example, when an ulcer develops externally on the skin, it can be soothed only by applying medication externally, not by merely hearing talks. Also, hunger and thirst can only be relieved by eating and drinking, but not by merely talking about food and water. In the same way, the disease ( panch-vishays) can only be cured when medication is applied externally.
2.4 "The method of applying that medication is as follows: When a person's skin touches a vishay, like women and other objects, that object 'enters' the antah-karans via the skin. Then, via the antah-karans, it 'enters' the jeev. The vishay was not initially generated from within the jeev or from the antah-karans. In fact, all vishays which currently spring forth from the antah-karans have definitely 'entered' from outside through the indriyas – in a previous life. Therefore, the medicine for eradicating attachment to the vishays is as follows: A person should refrain from touching objects like women and other tempting objects via the skin; he should not look at their beauty via the eyes, nor talk about them using the tongue; he should not listen to them or about them via the ears; he should not smell their fragrance through the nose. Through the five indriyas, if a person firmly abstains from the vishays in this way, then the 'flow' of the vishays cannot enter within from outside. For example, a water-well can only be cleaned when the small streamlets of water that flow into the well are clogged from their entrance with cloth rags. In the same way, by keeping control over the external indriyas, the external vishays cannot enter the antah-karans.
2.5 "A stomach illness can only be cured when medicine enters the stomach. In the same way, the vishays that have already accumulated in the antah-karans by the way of the indriyas should be eradicated by thinking of his own self as the atma. He should think, 'I am the atma. The indriyas and the antah-karans have absolutely no relationship with me'. With such firm thinking, by seeing Bhagvan's murti in that chaitanya ( jeev), and through the bliss of the atma, he should remain fulfilled. Take the example of a water-well that is completely full of water. The water in the well will prevent the flow of new water from entering the well. However, if the well is emptied by drawing water from it, then new water from outside will enter it. Similarly, through the bliss of the atma, a person should remain fulfilled within. Externally, he should obstruct the 'inflow' of the vishays through the indriyas. This is the only definite method for overcoming vicious natures, such as kam and krodh; they cannot be overcome by upvas alone. So please remember this thought firmly in your lives."

Gadhada II – 3
The Rasik Path - The Knowledge Of The atma
3.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Shravan sud 4 [2nd August 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a square cushion in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the paramhans were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a jhanjh and mrudang.
3.2 Then, with a gesture of His eyes, Shreeji Maharaj silenced the audience and said, "Those of you who are senior paramhans, please come to the front as I wish to speak to you."
3.3 So saying, Shreeji Maharaj continued, "For those who worship Bhagvan, there are two paths that lead to greatness, and there are also two paths that lead to downfall, all of which I shall now explain. One path is to offer bhakti to Bhagvan via the rasik path, and the other path is knowledge of the atma. Both can lead to greatness, but both can also lead to downfall. Of these, thousands have fallen from the rasik path, with only a few attaining Bhagvan. Even the great acharyas have encouraged the offering of bhakti via the rasik path. However, many have been ruined by it, and only a few have benefited.
3.4 "The reason for this is that when Bhagvan is described in a rasik way, Radhikaji and Lakshmiji, along with their companions, are also described together with Bhagvan. When women are described, obviously their physical features are also described. Then, how can the mind of the person who is describing them possibly remain undisturbed? In fact, the nature of the indriyas is such that they only develop affection for those vishays that are seductive. No woman in all the loks possesses beauty that matches the beauty of Radhikaji or Lakshmiji, nor is there anyone who has such a sweet voice as theirs; even the fragrance radiating from their bodies is unrivalled. Therefore, upon seeing or hearing about such beauty, how can a person not become infatuated? It is inevitable. Even if a person's mind is only slightly disturbed, he still falls from the path of kalyan. Therefore, all of this proves to be a great obstacle for those who worship Bhagvan via the rasik path.
3.5 "Now, brahm- gnan (knowledge of the atma) can also give rise to the following incorrect understanding: brahm itself assumes the svarup of Prakruti- Purush. Then, that brahm itself assumes the svarup of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiv. Thereafter, brahm assumes the sthavar and jangam svarups of creation. Subsequently, brahm also becomes the jeevs residing in those sthavar and jangam svarups of creation. By misunderstanding brahm- gnan in this way, a person then believes his own jeev to be Bhagvan, which causes him to betray his upasana. As a result, he also falls from the path of Bhagvan. So, in the path of brahm-gnan, such a betrayal of his upasana is a major obstacle. This is because the very Bhagvan who is to be understood as the cause and master of everything has been insulted. Therefore, a person with this understanding should also be known to have fallen from the path of kalyan.
3.6 "Now, while these two paths do lead to kalyan, the obstacles along the way are also extremely damaging. So, what should a person who desires kalyan do? Please answer this question."
3.7 All the paramhans then began to think, but no one was able to supply a suitable answer.
3.8 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "The answer to the question is as follows: A person's mind does not become infatuated on seeing his own mother, sister, or daughter, even if they are very beautiful. Moreover, even though he may talk with them, or even touch them, his mind is not even slightly infatuated. In the same way, if a person were to consider all female bhaktas of Bhagvan as his own mother, sister, or daughter, then infatuation would not arise in any way at all. Then, by worshipping Bhagvan via the rasik path, he would attain kalyan.
3.9 "However, when a person does not have such understanding, and has lustful thoughts on seeing some great female bhaktas of Bhagvan, his character becomes extremely flawed. Furthermore, the flaw arising from lustfully looking at other women is eradicated by having the darshan of a bhakta of Bhagvan. However, the shastras mention no method of eradicating the flaw arising from lustfully looking at a bhakta of Bhagvan. The same applies for a female who look at a male bhakta of Bhagvan and has lustful thoughts; they too can never be redeemed of that sin. This is described in the following verse: anya-kshetre krutam papam tirth-kshetre vina-shyati tirth-kshetre krutam papam vajra-lepo bhavi-shyati : Sins committed elsewhere are destroyed at a place of pilgrimage, but sins committed at a place of pilgrimage are as though etched in iron." The verse means: 'Sins committed elsewhere can be removed by going to Bhagvan or a bhakta of Bhagvan. However, if a person commits a sin before Bhagvan or His bhakta, then it is like committing a sin at a place of pilgrimage; it becomes irredeemable, as if etched in iron'. Therefore, a person who wishes to worship Bhagvan via the rasik path, should keep his mind pure, as I have explained.
3.10 "Now, a person on the path of brahm- gnan, should understand that brahm is not subject to change and is indivisible. Therefore, it does not undergo change, and it cannot be divided. When that brahm is equated with all svarups, it is because that brahm is the cause of Prakruti-Purush, and the cause of all. It is their supporter, and it pervades all through its antaryami powers. Furthermore, that which is the cause, the supporter, and which pervades everything, cannot be distinct from its effect. It is in reference to this context that the shastras equate that brahm with all forms. However, a person should not believe that brahm itself undergoes change and assumes the forms of all sthavar and jangam beings.
3.11 "Also, greater than that brahm is Parbrahm Purushottam Narayan, who is distinct from brahm, and is the cause, the supporter, and the controller of brahm. With this understanding, a person should develop oneness with his jeevatma and with that brahm, and worship Bhagvan while maintaining a master-servant relationship with Him. With this understanding, brahm-gnan also becomes an unobstructed path to attaining Akshardham."

Gadhada II – 4
The Loss Of Dharma And Bhakti
4.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Shravan sud 5[3rd August 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the west-facing medi in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the paramhans were singing kirtans in the malar rag to the accompaniment of a dukad, saroda, and satar.
4.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please stop the singing, and let us now talk about Bhagvan."
4.3 The paramhans responded, "Very well, Maharaj."
4.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Suppose a person, who follows dharma as prescribed in the shastras and also offers bhakti to Bhagvan, is faced with such unpleasant circumstances that if he tries to maintain bhakti, he is forced to lapse in his observance of dharma, and if he tries to maintain his observance of dharma, then he is forced to abandon bhakti. In such a case, which should he maintain, and which should he abandon?"
4.5 Brahmanand Swami replied, "If Bhagvan is pleased by upholding bhakti, then bhakti should be upheld; and if He is pleased by upholding dharma, then dharma should be upheld."
4.6 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj countered, "For those who have found pratyaksha Bhagvan, it is of course appropriate for them to do only that which pleases Bhagvan. But, what should a person do when Bhagvan is not pratyaksha?"
4.7 Muktanand Swami attempted to answer, but he was unable to do so satisfactorily.
4.8 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "If a person faces unpleasant circumstances when Bhagvan is not pratyaksha and there is no one else left to turn to, if he constantly thinks only about Bhagvan, he will not fall from the path of Bhagvan."
4.9 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked another question, "A person who thoroughly understands the greatness of Bhagvan feels, 'No matter how many sins a person may have committed, if he merely utters the name of Bhagvan even once, all of his sins will be burnt to ashes'. What understanding should a person with this belief develop, so that he never falters from the observance of dharma?"
4.10 Again, Muktanand Swami attempted to answer, but was unable to do so satisfactorily.
4.11 So, replying to His own question, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A person who thoroughly realises Bhagvan's greatness can still abide by dharma if he develops the following understanding: 'I want to constantly think about Bhagvan and become an ekantik bhakta. However, if my vrutti is drawn towards vicious natures, such as kam, krodh, and lobh, then that will be an obstruction in my thoughts of Bhagvan'. Realising this, he remains extremely cautious of treading the wrong path. As a result, he would never do anything related to adharma. If a person has this understanding, then even though he thoroughly realises the greatness of Bhagvan, he would never falter in his observance of dharma.
4.12 "Indeed, it is not a small deed to be able to think about Bhagvan constantly; if a person were to leave his body while thinking about Bhagvan, he would attain Akshardham."
4.13 Then, Brahmanand Swami asked, "We do realise this, yet we still cannot constantly think about Bhagvan. What is the reason for this?"
4.14 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "First of all, to be able to constantly think about Bhagvan, a person needs shraddha. If he does not have such shraddha, it implies that there is a deficiency in realising Bhagvan's greatness. When there is this deficiency, it suggests that there is also a deficiency in his nishchay in the svarup of Bhagvan. So, if a person realises the greatness of Bhagvan and also has shraddha, then he will be able to constantly think about Bhagvan.
4.15 "Furthermore, Bhagvan's greatness should be understood as follows: Bhagvan, who is greater than Prakruti-Purush, is the very same when he enters them; He still retains His divya powers. Even after He enters the entities evolved from Prakruti- Purush, like the brahmand, He retains the very same powers; but, in no way do traces of Maya affect Bhagvan's murti. For example, consider the difference between gold and other metals. When they are buried together in the ground for a long period of time, all the metals other than the gold will decompose into the dirt surrounding them. In comparison, the longer the gold stays in the ground, the more valuable it becomes, as it does not decompose in any way.
4.16 "Similarly, Bhagvan, devs such as Brahma and others, or other munis are not all the same. This is because when they come into contact with dirt ( vishays), then all except Bhagvan become engrossed in those vishays, regardless of how great they may be. Moreover, although Bhagvan seems to be like a human, there is no worldly object capable of affecting Him. Regardless of how attractive a vishay may be, He is never tempted by it. This is the alokik power of Bhagvan. If a person realises this greatness, he will be able to constantly think about Bhagvan.
4.17 "However, as long as a bhakta is attracted to vishays, he has not realised Bhagvan's alokik greatness at all. For example, Bhagvan said to Uddhavji, 'O Uddhav! You are not even slightly lesser than me'. This was because Uddhavji had realised Bhagvan's alokik greatness, and therefore was not attracted by the panch-vishays.
4.18 "For a person who realises the greatness of Bhagvan, to rule a kingdom or to have to beg for food, are both equivalent. He also feels the same towards a young girl, a 16-year-old girl, and an 80-year old woman. In fact, he views all the attractive and repulsive objects in this world as being equal; he does not get tempted by an attractive object as a moth does by a lamp. In fact, he is not tempted by any object except for Bhagvan; he is only attracted to the murti of Bhagvan. A bhakta who behaves in this way, never becomes bound by vishays, regardless of how tempting they may be.
4.19 "However, if a person has not understood this key principle, then it would be very difficult for him to detach his mind from even a torn waistcloth or a water-pot. Therefore, without realising Bhagvan's greatness in this way, even if a person makes an effort in a million other ways, he will still not be able to constantly think about the murti of Bhagvan. Only a person who realises the greatness of Bhagvan is able to constantly think about Him."

Fidelity And Courage
5.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Shravan sud 7[5th August 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a square cushion which had been placed on the platform in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the paramhans were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a mrudang.
5.2 Then, with a gesture of His eyes, Shreeji Maharaj stopped the kirtans and said, "Everyone please listen, as I wish to speak. A bhakta of Bhagvan should firstly maintain pati vrata, and secondly maintain courage. For example, consider a pati-vrata wife who abides by the vow of fidelity. Even if her husband is old, sick, poor, or ugly, the mind of that pati-vrata wife would never sway upon seeing the qualities of another man. Even if a beggar's wife, who observes this vow, were to see a great king, her mind would not waver. In a similar way, a bhakta of Bhagvan should follow the vow of pati vrata with Bhagvan.
5.3 "Furthermore, if someone were to speak ill of a woman's husband, then she will not remain timid and quiet. Instead, she will reply very courageously. In this way, a bhakta of Bhagvan should not become suppressed by evil people; he should be courageous.
5.4 "It is generally said that a sadhu should view everyone equally. However, this is not the principle of the shastras, as bhaktas like Narad, the Sanakadik, Dhruv, and Prahlad, have taken the side of only Bhagvan and His bhaktas; they have never taken the side of vimukhs. A person who does side with a vimukh, will himself definitely become a vimukh as well, either in this life or in the next. Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvan should certainly side with Bhagvan's bhaktas and abandon the side of vimukhs. Please firmly remember this talk of mine."

Gadhada II – 6
Vidhi And Nishedh - The Nature Of The Chitt
6.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Shravan sud 8 [6th August 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Swami was sitting on a square platform in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the paramhans were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a mrudang.
6.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please stop the singing and lets us now talk about Bhagvan."
6.3 Then, all the munis sat with their hands folded. Shreeji Maharaj then continued, "In this world, there are many people who are like nastiks. They believe, 'Water from the Ganga and other water seems the same; shaligrams and other stones seem the same; tulsi and other trees seem the same; a brahman and a shudra seem equal; food which is the prasad of Bhagvan and other food seems the same; to do upvas on the day of Ekadashi and to go hungry on any other day seems the same; and a sadhu and a non-sadhu also seem the same. Despite this, why have those great men made distinctions in the form of vidhi and nishedh in the shastras?' This is what is said by people with evil minds. That is why I put this question to all of you sadhus: Are those distinctions, in the form of vidhi and nishedh prescribed in the shastras by great men, genuine or fictional? May the junior paramhans answer this question."
6.4 The junior paramhans replied, "The distinctions in the form of vidhi and nishedh are indeed genuine. If this were not so, how could there be a distinction as to who deserves to attain Svarg-Lok and who deserves to attain Narak?"
6.5 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj commented, "They are young, but they understand well." Shreeji Maharaj then elaborated upon the answer Himself. "Whatever the great men of the past have prescribed in the shastras is genuine. Take the example of a wealthy businessman. If he writes a cheque to pay some other merchant, then although it seems that the piece of paper is not worth even a single rupee, it is indeed money. Only when the merchant cashes the cheque the businessman had signed, does the merchant subsequently receive a large sum of money from that very same cheque. Similarly, although at the time there may not seem to be any benefit in following the vidhi and nishedh, a person who does follow dharma by the agna of a great sant, ultimately attains kalyan – just as a person receives cash from cheques.
6.6 "Moreover, a person who does not trust a cheque signed by a wealthy businessman should be known to be a fool – because he does not realise the wealth of that businessman. Similarly, a person who does not trust the words of great bhaktas, such as Narad, the Sanakadik, Vyas, and Valmik, should be known as a nastik and a great sinner.
6.7 "Furthermore, a person who has such a nastik attitude believes, 'What is the difference between Bhagvan's murti and other stones? All stones are one and the same. What is the difference between a married woman and an unmarried woman? All women are equal. What is the difference between a person's wife, mother, or sister? After all, they all look alike. In fact, even all the avatars of Bhagvan, such as Ram and Krishna, look like humans. Surely, the concept of them being greater or lesser has been created by man's imagination. But, what can we do? We have to live with such people, so we have to agree with whatever they say. Nevertheless, the vidhi and nishedh prescribed by the shastras are definitely nonsense'. This is the understanding that sinners such as the nastiks have in their minds. If a person hears such words from someone, then the listener should be known as a sinner and a nastik; and realising him to be an outcast, he should by no means keep his company."
6.8 Shreeji Maharaj then began another topic. He said, "The chitt of all people is like honey, or like water saturated with sugar. For example, if a fly or an ant were to fall into that honey or water saturated with sugar, it would become stuck in it. Even if a person were to touch the honey or saturated water, it would stick to the person's finger as well. The nature of the chitt is similar to this; it sticks to whatever object it recalls. In fact, the chitt even attaches itself to things that are utterly insignificant, such as stones, or rubbish, or dog excrement – things in which there is not even the slightest pleasure. If it recalls such useless things, it will then also think about them. This is its sticky nature.
6.9 "Furthermore, just as the reflection of a great sadhu will be seen in a large, glass mirror if he stands before it, the reflection of a dog, a donkey, or an outcaste will also be seen if they stand before it. Similarly, the chitt is extremely pure; it can visualise whichever object it recalls, regardless of whether it is appealing or not. Therefore, a mumukshu should not think, 'As I do not possess vairagya, objects such as women and other attractive vishays develop in my chitt'. In actual fact, objects develop naturally even in the chitt of a person who does possess vairagya. Therefore, vairagya or the lack of it is not the reason behind this. Instead, the nature of the chitt is such that whatever it recalls; whether it is good or bad, the chitt thinks about. When it thinks about an object, it appears just as it would appear in mirror. That is why a person should realise, 'I am distinct from the chitt. I am the atma, the observer of the chitt'. Realising this, he should not become frustrated by the pure and impure thoughts arising in the chitt. Instead, he should realise himself to be distinct from his chitt, engage in the worship of Bhagvan, and always remain joyful."

Gadhada II – 7
Eradicating Svabhavs
7.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on the night of Shravan sud 11 [9th August 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
7.2 Then, Muktanand Swami asked Shreeji Maharaj, "A bhakta of Bhagvan decides in his mind, 'I do not want to retain a single svabhav which may obstruct me in worshipping Bhagvan'. However, inappropriate svabhavs still remain within him. What is the reason for this?"
7.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a person has a deficiency of vairagya, then even if he has the shraddha to eradicate his svabhavs, they will not be eradicated. For example, a poor man may wish for lots of delicious food and lavish clothes, but how can he acquire them? Similarly, a person who lacks vairagya may wish in his heart to acquire the qualities of a sadhu, but it is very difficult for him to do so."
7.4 Muktanand Swami then asked, "If a person does not possess vairagya, what method should he adopt to eradicate those vicious natures?"
7.5 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a person lacks vairagya, but intensely serves a great sant, and obeys the agna of Bhagvan, then Bhagvan will look upon him with an eye of compassion, and feel, 'This poor man lacks vairagya; and the vicious natures, like kam and krodh, are harassing him very much. So, may all of those vicious natures be eradicated'. As a result, they will be eradicated immediately. In comparison, if he were to attempt other methods, those svabhavs may be eradicated, but only after a great deal of time and effort – either in this life or in later lives. If such vicious natures are eradicated instantly, then it should be known that they have been eradicated by the grace of Bhagvan."

Gadhada II – 8
Ekadashi - Gnan-Yagna - Antar-Drashti
8.1 In the Samvat year 1878, in the early morning of Shravan sud 12 [10th August 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a square cushion in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the paramhans were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a mrudang.
8.2 Then, addressing the sadhus, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A person should keep the Ekadashi vrat because of the following story: Once, Bhagvan was sleeping with his ten indriyas and the mind (eleventh indriya) drawn inwards. At that time, Mur-Danav, the son of Nadi-Jandh, came to do battle with Bhagvan. A young woman was then created from the divine light of Bhagvan's eleven indriyas. Seeing her, Mur-Danav proposed to her, 'Please marry me'. The young woman replied, 'I have taken a vow that I will only marry the person who defeats me in a battle'. This resulted in a battle between Mur-Danav and the young woman, in which the young woman cut off Mur-Danav's head with a sword. Bhagvan was pleased with her and said, 'Ask for a vardan'. The young woman requested, 'On my day of vrat, no one should eat grains. Furthermore, as I was born from the divine light of your eleven indriyas, my name is Ekadashi. As I am a tyagi, on my day of vrat, no one should indulge in any of the vishays related to the eleven indriyas, which includes the mind'. Hearing Ekadashi's wish, Bhagvan granted her that vardan. This is the story as it is narrated in the Purans.
8.3 "The Dharma-Shastras also state: 'The Ekadashi vrat should be kept. On that day, a person should not allow impure thoughts, such as kam, krodh, and lobh, to arise in the mind; nor should he physically engage in any immoral activities'. This is what the shastras prescribe. In agreement with those shastras, I also say that on the day of Ekadashi, a person should not merely do upvas, but he should also abandon the 'food' of the eleven indriyas. Only then can the Ekadashi vrat be considered true; without that, it should be known as mere upvas.
8.4 "Just as the prans have their diet (food), the ears have a diet of sounds, the eyes have a diet of sights, the tongue has a diet of tastes, the nose has a diet of smells, and the mind has a diet of thoughts and desires. In this way, the eleven indriyas have their diets. To give up all these is called Ekadashi vrat. However, to allow the eleven indriyas to roam freely along the path of immorality and indulge in their 'foods' is not truly Ekadashi according to the shastras. Therefore, when keeping an Ekadashi vrat, the eleven indriyas should not be allowed their 'foods'. As this vrat arrives once every fifteen days, a person should definitely make a point of keeping it. In return, Bhagvan will become pleased. Without this, merely doing upvas does not please Him.
8.5 "The residents of Shvet-Dvip, who are called niranna- muktas, are continuously keeping this vrat, and they never allow it to be broken. That is precisely why they are called niranna muktas. We too should have such aspirations as, 'I want to become like those niranna-muktas in Shvet-Dvip'. However, a person should not lose courage. Only if he keeps courage and keeps the Ekadashi vrat in the way I have mentioned, listens to kathas and kirtans of Bhagvan, and also stays awake at night, is the vrat considered to have been kept properly. This is the very definition of the Ekadashi vrat as mentioned in the shastras."
8.6 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj became silent. The sadhus then began to sing kirtans.
8.7 Then, Shreeji Maharaj again said, "When Brahma carried out the very first creation, he told all the people, 'You should all perform yagnas. Through them you will attain all the purusharths, and the process of creation will also flourish. Therefore, be sure to perform these sacrifices'. Brahma then demonstrated the many different types of yagnas, along with their rituals, as described in the Veds. To those who had adopted the path of pravrutti, Brahma demonstrated the rajasi and tamasi yagnas. To those who had adopted the path of nivrutti, he demonstrated sattvik yagnas. These yagnas have also been described by Shree Krishna Bhagvan in the Bhagvad Geeta. Since we have adopted the path of nivrutti, we should perform sattvik yagnas, not rajasi or tamasi yagnas in which animals are slaughtered.
8.8 "A person can perform a sattvik yagna by withdrawing the ten indriyas and the mind (the eleventh indriya) from whichever vishays they have become attached to, and then offering them into brahm-agni. This is called a yog- yagna. By continuously making these offerings, Parbrahm Shree Purushottam incarnates Himself with the brahm- svarup self of the person who performs a yoga- yagna, just as Bhagvan grants darshan to the performer of a yagna. In fact, this is the reward of the yog-yagna.
8.9 "Also, when a bhakta of Bhagvan engages in antar-drashti, it is called a gnan-yagna. Someone may ask, 'What is antar-drashti?' The answer is: To direct a person's internal or external vrutti towards the murti of Bhagvan is itself antar-drashti. Without doing this, even if a person is sitting and seemingly engaged in antar-drashti, it is still bahya-drashti. Therefore, physical activities related to Bhagvan, such as having the darshan of Bhagvan, performing His puja or engaging in katha and kirtans of Bhagvan, are all forms of antar-drashti. All of these are aspects of a gnan-yagna. In addition, to see that murti of Bhagvan within the heart, to perform its puja, and to bow before it, is also antar-drashti, and they are also aspects of a gnan-yagna. For this reason, all satsangis are continuously performing gnan-yagna. However, it is by the wish of Bhagvan that some attain samadhi and others do not. Sometimes it could also be that the bhakta himself has some sort of deficiency.
8.10 "There are foolish people who say, 'Do not sing kirtans which describe the gopis; sing only nirgun kirtans'. Those same fools claim that a person who roams around naked is nirgun. But, if a person could become nirgun by merely walking around naked, then even dogs, donkeys, and other animals would be called nirgun. This is the understanding of fools.
8.11 "In comparison, a bhakta possessing gnan understands that only the svarup Bhagvan is nirgun, and all those who have some relation to Bhagvan are followers of the nirgun path. Furthermore, any katha or kirtan associated with Bhagvan is also considered nirgun. However, katha or kirtan which are not associated with Bhagvan possess mayik qualities, and should be considered to be sagun. So, if a person has not been graced with the attainment of Bhagvan, then even if he walks around naked, he cannot be called nirgun; whereas even if a grahastha has been graced with the attainment of Bhagvan, he can still be called nirgun – as can a tyagi.' Therefore, the path to attaining Bhagvan is itself the nirgun path, and all activities related to Bhagvan are therefore also nirgun.
8.12 "As for a person who has come into contact with Bhagvan, there is no limit to his good fortune. However, such a relationship with Bhagvan is not the result of rewards from one life alone. That is why Shree Krishna Bhagvan has stated in the Bhagvad Geeta: anek-janma-sansiddh-stato yati param gatim : A yogi who has become siddh after many lives, attains Akshardham." The meaning of this shlok is: 'A person becomes a yogi and attains Akshardham after the good deeds of many lives have accumulated'. What is this Akshardham? Well, the attainment of the pratyaksha Bhagvan is itself Akshardham.
8.13 "Shree Krishna Bhagvan has also said: mamai-vansho jeev-loke jeev-bhootaha sanatanaha manaha-shashtha-neendriyani prakruti-sthani karshati" This shlok means: 'In this world, those jeevs who are bhaktas of Bhagvan withdraw their mind and five gnan-indriyas away from the panch-vishays and keep them suppressed. On the other hand, those who are not bhaktas of Bhagvan are drawn by their indriyas and are taken where the indriyas wish to go'. As we are not led astray by our indriyas, we should realise ourselves to be bhaktas of Bhagvan. With this understanding, we should remain joyful, should engage in the worship of Bhagvan, and should offer all the vruttis of our indriyas to Bhagvan. We should continuously perform a gnan-yagna in this way.
8.14 "Without performing such yagnas, there is no way to attain kalyan. The four Veds, the Sankhya shastras, the Yog shastras, the Dharma-Shastras, the eighteen Purans, the Mahabharat, the Ramayan, the Narad Panch-Ratra, and all other shastras, share the principles that kalyan cannot be attained without performing yagnas.
8.15 "It is also my agna that all paramhans and all satsangis should continue performing a gnan-yagna. While performing a gnan-yagna in this way, a person ultimately has the divine darshan of Parbrahm within his own self, which is brahm. This is the reward of the gnan-yagna. The highest point of the gnan- yagna ritual is when a person becomes like a niranna- mukta of Shvet-Dvip. As long as a person has not attained this state, he should realise that the gnan-yagna is incomplete. In fact, he should have a strong desire to become like a niranna- mukta. In the process, he should not lose faith, and he should not consider himself to be unfulfilled. Since he has been graced with the attainment of Bhagvan, he should consider himself to be absolutely fulfilled, and he should attentively continue performing the gnan-yagna."

Gadhada II – 9
Never Insult The Svarup Of Bhagvan
9.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Shravan sud 14 [12th August 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a square cushion in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. anandanand Swami had just performed His puja. Shreeji Maharaj was wearing a red surval and dagli made from kinkhab. He had tied an orange reto with a golden border around His head, and had tied an embroidered shelu around His waist. On His shoulder was a sky-blue coloured reto. Several rakhadis were tied around His wrist. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
9.2 Then, Muktanand Swami suggested, "Let us sing kirtans."
9.3 Shreeji Maharaj said, "Let us talk about Bhagvan." He then continued, "The path of gnan should be understood in a way that does not cause a person to criticise the svarup of Bhagvan in any way. In fact, a person should not worry if at some time or other he has disobeyed Bhagvan's agnas; but he should never criticise the svarup of Bhagvan. If he does disobey Bhagvan's agnas, then he can still be freed from that sin by praying to Bhagvan. However, there are no means of release for a person who has criticised the svarup of Bhagvan. Therefore, a person who is wise should certainly abide by Bhagvan's agnas to the best of his ability. However, he should also intensely maintain the strength of belief in Bhagvan's svarup: 'I have attained the very svarup of Bhagvan who reigns supreme, who forever possesses a divya svarup, and who is the 'avatari' – the cause of all the avatars'. If a person realises this, then even if he may have left satsang, his love for Bhagvan's svarup will not diminish. In fact, even though he is out of satsang at present, when he leaves his body, he will go to Bhagvan's Akshardham and stay near Bhagvan.
9.4 "On the other hand, a person may be in satsang, and he may even be abiding by the agnas prescribed in the shastras. However, if his belief of Bhagvan is not firm, then when he leaves his body, he will either go to the lok of Brahma or to the lok of some other dev; but he will not go to the dham of Purushottam Bhagvan. Therefore, a person should believe that the pratyaksha Bhagvan that he has attained possesses a divya svarup, and is the 'avatari' – the cause of all the avatars. However, if a person does not have this belief, and instead believes Bhagvan to be nirakar or like the other avatars, then that is regarded as committing blasphemy against Bhagvan.
9.5 "Now, consider the following: Arjun's spiritual strength was based on his belief of Bhagvan, whereas Yudhishthir's source of strength was his faith in the words of the shastras. Then, when the Mahabharat war was fought, Shree Krishna Bhagvan said to Arjun: sarva-dharman-parityajya mam-ekam sharanam vraja aham tvam sarva-papebhyo mokshayi-shyami ma shuchaha" The meaning of this shlok is, 'O Arjun! Abandon all the various types of dharma and surrender only to me. I shall deliver you from all sins, so do not grieve'. By keeping faith in these words, Arjun never became disheartened, despite committing countless misdeeds during the war. He maintained firm faith in Bhagvan. Conversely, Yudhishthir had not committed any sins, but because he had faith in the words of the shastras, he felt, 'I shall never attain kalyan'. Even when all the rushis, Vyasji, and even Shree Krishna Bhagvan Himself attempted to explain to him, still he did not abandon his guilt. Yudhishthir only developed some faith when Shree Krishna Bhagvan took him to Bhishma and had him listen to Bhishma's katha on the true meaning of the words of the shastras. However, he did not become totally free of doubt like Arjun. Therefore, a person who is intelligent should maintain intense belief of the svarup of Bhagvan.
9.6 "Even the slightest strength based on the belief of Bhagvan, will protect a person from great dangers. Shree Krishna Bhagvan has also said, svalpa-mapyasya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat" This shlok means, 'If a person has the slightest strength based on the belief of Bhagvan, it will protect him from great misfortune. For example, when Arjun fought in the Mahabharat war, he encountered many types of severe dangers in the form of adharma. However, he was spared from those dangers because of his belief of Bhagvan. Therefore, only he can be called an ekantik bhakta whose strength is based on the belief of Bhagvan more than anything else; and only he can be called a perfect satsangi. The Shreemad Bhagvat also mentions: 'If a person strays from the dharma stated in the Shrutis and Smrutis, he should not worry. However, he should never abandon the refuge of Bhagvan'.
9.7 "As a result, some may feel, 'If we promote such talks, dharma will become irrelevant.' However, this principle is not intended to make dharma irrelevant; its purpose is as follows: Desh, kal, kriya, sang, mantras, shastras, updesh, and devs, can be of two types – pure and impure. Of these, if a person were to encounter the impure, and if as a result some difficulties were to arise, then if he has the firm belief of Bhagvan, he would never fall from the path of kalyan. Conversely, if there is a deficiency in his belief of Bhagvan, then whenever he falters from dharma, he would feel, 'I am destined to fall into Narak'. Therefore, only a person whose strength is based on the belief of Bhagvan is a loyal satsang i. Without this, a person is merely appreciative of satsang. Even the shastras mention that only a person who firmly maintains the belief of Bhagvan is called an ekantik bhakta."
9.8 "Also, if Narad, the Sanakadik, and the devs, were to hear the talks being presently delivered in satsang, they would say, 'We have never heard such talks before, and we shall never hear them again'. These talks can be described as: na bhooto na bhavishyati : Never before have there been, and never again will there be." Although these talks are extremely small, even a person of average intelligence can understand them. It is as if these talks are personified. Therefore, there is no limit to the rewards of a person who, at this present time, has a belief of satsang. Realising this, those who are satsang is should consider themselves to be totally fulfilled. Moreover, a person who has profound love for Bhagvan, regardless of whether he understands this talk, has nothing left to do. On the other hand, if a person does not have such profound love for Bhagvan, then he should definitely realise the greatness of Bhagvan. Therefore, a person who is wise should think about this talk, understand it, and then take extremely firm refuge in Bhagvan. This principle alone is the very essence of all essences."

Gadhada II – 10
Nishchay In Bhagvan
10.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Shravan vad 3 [16th August 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj arrived at Lakshmi-Vadi on horseback from Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He then sat facing north on the square platform under a mango tree in the middle of a field of flowers. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
10.2 Then Shreeji Maharaj said, "The Shreemad Bhagvat proclaims that Brahm is sakar. However, if those who read it do not have bhakti of Bhagvan, they will understand Bhagvan to be nirakar, even from reading the Shreemad Bhagvat. Also, from the second skandh, which describes the characteristics of the refuge of Bhagvan, those who are lacking in bhakti will again understand Bhagvan to be nirakar. In reality, Bhagvan is not nirakar. This is because it is through Bhagvan that everything sthavar and jangam is created. Now, if Bhagvan was nirakar, then how could He create something that is sakar? For example, akash is nirakar. Therefore, trees, mountains, and other forms that can be created from pruthvi cannot be created from that akash. In the same way, since Brahma and the rest of creation is sakar, Bhagvan, their creator, is also definitely sakar.
10.3 "Also, the Shreemad Bhagvat states: 'The supporter of adhyatma, adhibhut, and adhidev, is Bhagvan'. Now, I shall explain how, so please listen carefully. Adhyatma (the indriyas of Virat), adhibhut (the five maha- bhuts of Virat), and adhidev (the presiding devs of the indriyas of Virat), all entered Virat. Despite this, Virat was unable to awaken. Then, Vasudev Bhagvan assumed the svarup of Purush and entered Virat, which caused Virat- Purush to awaken. Bhagvan therefore acts with oneness with the adhyatma, adhibhut, and adhidev of Virat- Purush. However, in reality He is distinct from Virat, and only this svarup of Bhagvan is said to be worthy of seeking refuge.
10.4 "For example, fire in the form of light is nirakar, while Agni himself possesses a definite murti. Moreover, when Agni suffered from indigestion (unable to digest ghee in the fire), he came to Krishna and Arjun in his personified svarup. Then, when he went to burn the Khandav forest of Indra, that same Agni assumed the svarup of flames and spread throughout the whole forest. In the same way, Purushottam Bhagvan pervades all through His antaryami powers, which are brahm- rup. However, possessing a definite murti, He is also distinct from all. Brahm itself is a ray of the light of Purushottam Bhagvan, while Bhagvan Himself always possesses a murti. Therefore, a person who aspires to attain kalyan should realise Bhagvan to possess a definite murti and should maintain His firm refuge.
10.5 "Also, he should speak in such a way that does not break someone's refuge of Bhagvan. For example, just as a woman who carries a foetus in her womb attains a child, person who carries a foetus ( nishchay) in Bhagvan, attains Bhagvan's Akshardham. Therefore, a person should practice methods that never endanger the foetus. He should also talk to others in such a way that that foetus ( nishchay) in Bhagvan does not miscarry."
10.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj returned to Dada Khachar's darbar from Lakshmi-Vadi. He sat on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
10.7 Shreeji Maharaj then summoned the junior paramhans and began a discussion amongst them. Achintyanand Swami then asked a question: "From gnan, vairagya, and bhakti, which one plays a more significant role in the development of love for Bhagvan?"
10.8 No, one was able to answer that question. So, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I shall answer that question, and I shall also describe the characteristics of gnan, vairagya, and bhakti.
10.9 "All people have a tendency such that on seeing an attractive object, their affection for any object that is not as attractive will naturally diminish. Therefore, before the bliss of Bhagvan's Akshardham, these worldly pleasures seem artificial; permanent bliss can only be found in the dham of Bhagvan. For that reason, if a person realises the bliss of Bhagvan while listening to talks about Bhagvan, then everything that has evolved from Maya will appear worthless. For example, a man with a copper coin in his hand will lose affection for it when someone offers him a gold coin in exchange. In the same way, when a person realises the bliss related to Bhagvan, he develops vairagya towards all worldly pleasures, and he develops love only for the murti of Bhagvan. That is the characteristic of vairagya.
10.10 "Now, I shall describe the characteristics of gnan. There are two sets of shastras that explain gnan: One set is the Sankhya shastras, and the other set is the Yog shastras.
10.11 "Of these, the philosophy of the Sankhya shastras is as follows: akash pervades pruthvi, jal, tej, and vayu, and there is not even a tiny speck that is not filled with akash; still the shortcomings of pruthvi, jal, tej, and vayu, do not effect akash at all. In the same way as akash, no mayik flaw can affect Purushottam Bhagvan. This fact is mentioned in the Krishnatapni Upanishad as follows: When Durvasa Rushi came to Vrundavan, Shree Krishna Bhagvan told the gopis, 'Durvasa Rushi is hungry; so all of you take dishes of food and go to him'.
10.12 "Then, the gopis replied, 'But, the Yamuna flows along the way. How shall we be able to cross it?'
10.13 "Shree Krishna Bhagvan replied, 'Tell Yamunaji that if Shree Krishna is forever a brahm-chari, then please make way for us'.
10.14 "Laughing, the gopis went to the banks of the Yamunaji and said this. Immediately, Yamunaji gave way. The gopis fed the rushi, and he in turn ate all the food. Then the gopis asked him, 'How shall we return home, as the Yamuna flows along the way?'
10.15 "The rushi then asked them, 'How did you get here?'
10.16 "The gopis then explained, 'Shree Krishna had told us that if he has been a brahm-chari since childhood, then ask Yamunaji to give way. Therefore, Yamunaji gave way, and we have come to you'.
10.17 "Hearing this, the rushi said, 'Tell Yamunaji that if Durvasa is continuously fasting, then please give way to us'.
10.18 "Again, laughing, the gopis said this. Immediately, Yamunaji gave way. On seeing these two incidents, the gopis were totally astonished.
10.19 "Therefore, the svarup of Bhagvan is unaffected in the same way as akash. Despite being the doer of all actions, Bhagvan still remains a non-doer; and although He is associated with all, He remains absolutely detached. In this way, the Sankhya shastras describe Bhagvan as being unaffected. To understand this, is gnan according to the Sankhya philosophy.
10.20 "Now, I shall explain the philosophy of the Yog shastras, so please listen. The philosophy of Yog is that whoever wishes to perform dhyan on Bhagvan should first stabilise his vision. To stabilise the vision, it should first be fixed upon the murti of Bhagvan or some other object. Then, while staring at the same object, the vision becomes steady; and with it, the antah-karans also becomes steady. When the antah-karans becomes steady, Bhagvan's murti should be visualised in the heart. This would not be difficult for the yogi who attempts to visualise the murti; he can behold it quite easily. However, if a person does not stabilise his antah-karans through practice from the beginning, then when he performs dhyan on Bhagvan, many other types of disturbing thoughts arise and obstruct his path.
10.21 "Therefore, the principle of the Yog shastras is as follows: 'The vrutti should first be stabilised through practice before it is attached to Bhagvan'. Realising this is gnan according to the Yog shastras. Therefore, to strengthen a person's understanding through the philosophies of these two shastras, is known as gnan.
10.22 "Now, the method of practicing bhakti is as follows: When the ocean was churned, Lakshmiji emerged from the ocean. After taking a marriage garland in her hand, Lakshmiji thought, 'Who is suitable for marriage? I shall marry him'. Then, wherever she looked and examined, whoever was handsome lacked qualities, and whoever possessed qualities lacked beauty. In this way, she noticed great deficiencies in many. She also saw deficiencies in all the devs and all the demons. Finally, seeing that it was only Bhagvan who was complete with all qualities, without any faults at all, and the source of all bliss, Lakshmiji developed profound bhakti towards Bhagvan. With intense love, she placed the marriage garland around Bhagvan's neck, and married Bhagvan. Therefore, to realise such kalyan-kari qualities in Bhagvan and to seek His firm refuge is known as bhakti."
10.23 Hearing this, Muktanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, I have not yet quite understood which of the three ( gnan, vairagya, or bhakti) has the greater power in developing love for Bhagvan."
10.24 Then, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Bhakti has a lot of power; and while gnan and vairagya also have power, it is not as much as in bhakti. However, true bhakti is extremely rare. The characteristics of those who possess bhakti are as follows: When Bhagvan assumes a svarup like a human and travels on this earth for the sake of the kalyan of the jeevs, many of Bhagvan's charitras are divya, and many appear to be mayik. When Bhagvan assumed the avatar of Krishna, He gave darshan to Devki and Vasudev in a four-armed svarup; He also lifted Mount Govardhan; He cleaned Yamuna's waters of poison by removing Kaliya - Nag; He suppressed the infatuation of Brahma; and gave darshan to Akrur in the waters of the Yamuna. He also dispersed the grief of all the Yadavs by killing the wrestlers, an elephant, as well as wicked persons like Kans. Similarly, in the avatar of Ram, He broke the bow and also dispersed the grief of the devs by killing wicked persons such as Ravan. These and other such leelas are known as the divya charitras of Bhagvan.
10.25 "However, when Sita was abducted, Ramchandraji appeared to have become insane due to constant crying. In the avatar of Krishna, He fled from Kalyavan, was defeated by Jarasandh, and also had to surrender His kingdom in Mathura to go and settle on an island in the sea. These and other similar actions of Bhagvan appear to be human-like. Even a sinner would perceive divya qualities in the divya charitras of Bhagvan. However, a true bhakta of Bhagvan would perceive divya qualities even when Bhagvan performs human-like charitra. In the Geeta, Bhagvan has said: janma karma cha me divyam-evam yo vetti tattva-taha tyaktva deham punar-janma naiti ma-meti sorjuna" This shlok means: 'O Arjun! My birth and my actions are divya. Whoever realises them as divya will not take another birth when he leaves his body; instead, he will attain me'. So, whenever Bhagvan performs divya charitras, they appear divya to both a bhakta and to a person who is not a bhakta. However, when Bhagvan performs human-like actions, a true bhakta still perceives divya qualities in them, but by no means does he perceive avgun in the human-like charitras of Bhagvan. Having this understanding is known as having bhakti towards Bhagvan. In fact, only such bhaktas earn the rewards mentioned in the above shlok.
10.26 "The gopis were bhaktas of Bhagvan, and they never perceived avgun in Bhagvan in any way. On the other hand, King Parikshit perceived avgun in Bhagvan just by listening to the talks about the gopis. Shukji then explained those avgun to be false by illustrating the powers of Bhagvan. Therefore, it is very rare to have bhakti in which a person perceives all the charitras of Bhagvan as being divya, as the gopis did, and never perceives avgun by understanding them to be human-like. In fact, it is not achieved by merely doing good deeds for one or two lives. Only when the pure sanskars of many lives accumulate, does bhakti like that of the gopis develop. In fact, this bhakti is itself Akshardham. It is this type of bhakti that is greater than gnan and vairagya. If a person has such bhakti in his heart, what would be lacking in his love for Bhagvan? Nothing would be lacking."

Gadhada II – 11
All Karmas Becoming A Form Of Bhakti
11.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Shravan vad 5 [18th August 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
11.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "After listening to all the shastras, some people believe that they only deal with dharma, arth, and kam. Thinking this, they themselves also perform religious karmas, such as yagnas and vrats, only for the attainment of dharma, arth, and kam. As a result, they enjoy the rewards of these karmas in Dev-Lok, Brahm-Lok, or Mrutyu-Lok. Then, they return to the cycle of births and deaths. Therefore, the religious karmas that a person performs while holding a desire for dharma, arth, and kam, all become sattvik, rajasi, and tamasi; and the rewards of those karmas are enjoyed while staying in the loks of Svarg, Mrutyu-Lok, and Patal. However, they do not attain the gunatit dham of Bhagvan. As long as a person does not attain kalyan, the miseries of births, deaths, and Narak do not diminish.
11.3 "So, if a person abandons the desire for the rewards related to dharma, arth, and kam, and if he performs religious karmas only to please Bhagvan, then those religious karmas become a form of bhakti and aid in the attainment of kalyan. This is described in the following shlok: amayo yena bhoota-nam jayate yash-che suvrat tad-eva hyamayam dravyam na punati chikit-sitam evam nrunam kriya-yogaha sarve sansruti-hetavaha ta evatma-vinashaya kalpante kalpitaha pare : O observer of religious vows (Vyas)! Does not that same food which causes illness in beings – if purified and prescribed by a qualified doctor – cure that illness? Similarly, if all of a person's karmas – which normally cause him to pass through births and deaths – are offered to Bhagvan instead, those same karmas are destroyed, and are no longer capable of causing birth and deaths. Instead, they lead to his kalyan." The essence of this shlok is as I have described earlier.
11.4 "However, this fact is actually very complex, and if it is not fully understood, then on seeing a bhakta of Bhagvan behaving in the same way as all ignorant people do, a person would perceive avgun in him. As a result, the person who perceives the avgun would be sent to Narak.
11.5 "But, there is a vast difference between the actions of a bhakta of Bhagvan and the actions of a vimukh. How? Well, all actions of a vimukh are for pampering his indriyas, whereas all actions of a bhakta of Bhagvan are solely for serving Bhagvan and His bhaktas. As a result, the bhakta's actions are a form of bhakti.
11.6 "Moreover, bhakti is like gnan in the sense that both are a form of non- karma. Therefore, all of a bhakta's actions are in a form of karmas that do not cause attachment. This is described in a shlok in the Bhagvad Geeta: karmanya-karma yaha pashyed-akarmani cha karma yaha sa buddhiman-manushyeshu sa yuktaha krutsna-karma-krut" The meaning of this shlok is as follows: If a person sees non- karma ( gnan) in the karmas performed by the bhaktas of Bhagvan for the purpose of pleasing Bhagvan, and he sees a vimukh who has adopted the path of nivrutti as living by non- karmas, then such a person is said to possess gnan and is the most intelligent amongst all people; he is a yogi; he is worthy to attain kalyan, and is krutsna-karma-krut (has performed all karmas).
11.7 "Therefore, if a person perceives avgun in a bhakta of Bhagvan who, by Bhagvan's agna, performs karmas for the purpose of pleasing Bhagvan, then adharma and its followers will enter and reside in his heart."

Gadhada II – 12
The Art Of Ruling
12.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Shravan vad 6 [19th August 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
12.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I wish to talk to you, so please listen. In the talk I am about to deliver, I shall describe only one spiritual activity for attaining kalyan, but it is so powerful that all other spiritual activities are incorporated within it. It is as follows:
12.3 "The jeev, which resides in the body, feels, 'Kam, krodh, and other vicious natures are attached to my jeev'. In this way, depending on which of the vicious natures is predominant in a person, he believes his jeev to be full of that nature due to his association with it. However, not a single one of these vicious natures lies within the jeev; the jeev has merely believed itself to possess them out of its own foolishness.
12.4 "Therefore, a person who wishes to attain Akshardham should make an effort, but he should not relax or lose courage. Also, he should think, 'Just as the four antah-karans, the ten indriyas, and the five prans reside in this body, similarly, I am the jeevatma, and I also reside in this body. However, I am greater than all of them, and I am their controller'. But, he should not think, 'I am insignificant, whereas the antah-karans and indriyas are strong'. For example, if a king were to possess little or no intelligence, then even the members of his own family would not obey his orders. When the people in the village hear about this, no one in the village would obey his orders. Also, when the people throughout the kingdom hear about this, no one in the kingdom would obey his orders. As a result, the king would become depressed and powerless. He would sit idly and would not attempt to enforce his rule over anyone.
12.5 "In this analogy, the king symbolises the jeev, the members of the household symbolise the antah-karans, and the people of the village and kingdom symbolise the indriyas. So, if the jeev becomes discouraged and relaxes its authority, then when it wishes to use its power over the antah-karans and adjust them towards Bhagvan, the antah-karans will not follow. Also, if it wishes to control the indriyas, even the indriyas will not comply. Then, even though the jeev is the king of the kingdom (body), it becomes helpless like a beggar. When a king becomes discouraged, his subjects who live in his kingdom assume power and do not allow him to use his authority at all. Likewise, in the kingdom (body) of the jeev, the vicious natures – who are not the king – take control. Then, they do not allow the jeev to have any power.
12.6 "Therefore, a person who aspires to attain kalyan should never become timid, and should employ whatever measures are necessary to force the indriyas and antah-karans to accept his authority – like a king who studies books about the art of ruling and then uses authority over his kingdom, but is not suppressed by his subjects. However, if the king did not know the art of ruling, the people would not obey his orders. Instead, they would become unhappy, or he himself would behave miserably because no one would obey his rule. In this way, not knowing the art of ruling results in two unfortunate consequences. Similarly, if the jeev were to attempt to rule the kingdom (body) without understanding the art of ruling, then it would never become happy."
12.7 Then, Muktanand Swami asked Shreeji Maharaj, "How should a person, who wishes to attain kalyan, learn the art of ruling?"
12.8 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The art of ruling should be learnt in the following way: First of all, a person should thoroughly realise the greatness of Bhagvan. Then, he should conquer his mind by performing dhyan on Bhagvan's murti. He should conquer his ears by listening to talks related to Bhagvan, but he should not allow worldly talks to be heard by the ears. In the same way, the skin should only be allowed to touch Bhagvan and the bhaktas of Bhagvan. The eyes should only be allowed to do darshan of Bhagvan and His bhaktas. The tongue should forever sing the praises of Bhagvan and taste only the prasad of Bhagvan. The nose should only be allowed to smell the fragrance of flowers and other objects that have been blessed by Bhagvan. None of the indriyas should be allowed to follow the unrighteous path. When a person behaves in this way, no one can overthrow his authority in the kingdom (body).
12.9 "Only a person who makes an effort in this way and totally discards timidity is said to be walking on the path of kalyan. This is an extremely great method for overcoming his svabhavs. If this method of personal effort is practiced vigilantly, then all spiritual activities for attaining kalyan are incorporated within the one activity. Therefore, personal effort itself is the greatest of all spiritual activities for attaining kalyan."

Gadhada II – 13
The Svarup Within The Divine Light
13.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Shravan vad Amas [27th August 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a square cushion on the veranda outside the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a white pagh around His head. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
13.2 Raising both arms in the air, Shreeji Maharaj signalled the sabha to settle down and listen. Turning to the sadhus who were humbly praying before Him with folded hands, Shreeji Maharaj said, "O paramhans! All the senior sadhus, along with those who are wise, please come to the front. Please listen very carefully to what I am about to say. What I am about to say to you, I am not saying out of any pretence, or out of any pride, or to spread my own greatness. To be more precise, it is because I feel that amongst all of you sadhus and bhaktas, if someone can understand my message, it will tremendously benefit him; that is my purpose in narrating it. Moreover, this talk is based on what I have seen and realised through my own experience. In fact, it is also in agreement with the shastras. Although I feel that it is not appropriate to discuss this in public, I shall tell you nonetheless.
13.3 "I naturally remain in a state in which even if I wished to engage my mind in the most charming sounds, the most charming touch, the most charming smells, the most charming tastes, and the most charming sights of this world, I could not do so; I remain absolutely unhappy towards them. In fact, all the attractive vishays and the repulsive vishays are the same to me. Also, a king and a beggar are the same to me; and to rule all the loks and to beg for food with a broken begging bowl are the same to me; and sitting with honour on an elephant and walking on foot are the same to me. Whether someone honours me with sandalwood paste, flowers, fine clothes, and ornaments, or throws dirt on me – all are the same to me. Whether someone praises me or insults me – both are the same to me. Gold, silver, diamonds, and waste are all the same to me. Moreover, I look upon all bhaktas of Bhagvan as being equal – I do not differentiate one bhakta as being superior and another bhakta as being inferior.
13.4 "I have intense vairagya in my antah-karans, yet I am not burdened by it. I do not feel burdened like a person who carries a heavy rock on his head or ties a purse full of money and gold coins around his waist. My strict observance of svadharma does not burden me, nor does the understanding that I am brahm burden me. When I superficially praise an object or criticise another, I do so purposefully. Whenever I forcefully engage the vruttis of my indriyas towards objects, they remain there unwillingly; as soon as I relax that force, they withdraw immediately. It is like throwing a stone into the air – it goes as high as it can depending on the force of the throw, but ultimately it falls back to earth. Also, consider the example of a weak animal. It can stand only as long as a man forcefully supports it; but as soon as he withdraws the support, the animal slumps onto the ground. In addition, imagine a very strong man who is able to crack a betel nut between his teeth. However, after sucking ten or twenty very sour lemons, he would have great difficulty chewing even roasted chick-peas. In this way, it is only when I forcefully engage my vruttis in the vishays that they remain engaged in them.
13.5 "What is the cause of my behaving like this? Well, it is because the vruttis of my indriyas constantly remain inverted towards my hruday-akash. In that hruday-akash, I see extremely luminous divine light. Just as the clouds cover the entire sky during the monsoon season, only that light pervades my heart.
13.6 "Amidst that divine light I see the extremely luminous murti of Bhagvan. The murti is dark, but due to the intensity of the light, it appears to be fair, not dark. The murti has two arms and two legs, not four, eight or a thousand arms; and its appearance is very charming. The murti is very tranquil; it has a human svarup; and it appears young like a teenager. Sometimes the murti in the divine light is seen standing; sometimes sitting; and at other times, it is seen walking around. It is surrounded by groups of muktas on all four sides, who are seated facing Him, and who are engaged in looking at that murti of Bhagvan with a fixed gaze. I see that murti in its pratyaksha svarup before me at this very moment. I saw it before I came into this satsang; I could see it when I was in my mother's womb; in fact, I could see it even before I entered my mother's womb. Moreover, I am speaking to you while sitting there (hruday-akash). I do not see this village of Gadhada or even this veranda. I see all of you sitting there as well.
13.7 "Whoever realises this svarup will never be drawn towards the pleasures of the vishays. In fact, you also see this svarup of Bhagvan, but you do not fully understand it. However, when you come to understand this fact, you will not come across any difficulty in suppressing the desires of the panch-vishays and svabhavs, such as kam and krodh; they will be suppressed easily.
13.8 "That consistent divine light is referred to as the atma, Brahm, or Akshardham. The murti of Bhagvan within the light, is called the essence of the atma, Parbrahm, or Purushottam. It is that same Bhagvan who, for the kalyan of countless jeevs, incarnates on this earth in different yugs, in the avatars such as Ram and Krishna. In this lok, He appears to be like a human being, but He is not; He is the lord of Akshardham. Shree Krishna Bhagvan has said in the Geeta: na tad-bhasyate suryo na shashanko na pavakaha yad-gatva na nivartante tad-dhama paramam mama : My supreme dham is not illuminated by Surya, or by Chandra, or by Agni. Having attained my dham, no one returns from it." Therefore, even though Shree Krishna Bhagvan appeared to be like a human, He is still greater than Akshar and is divya.
13.9 "Whoever performs dhyan on the human murti of Bhagvan sees the luminous, divya murti seated in Akshardham. A person, who performs dhyan in this way, passes through Maya and attains Akshardham. So, even though Bhagvan assumes a human body, He is still divya, and the place where He resides is also nirgun. His clothes, jewellery, vehicles, sevaks, food, drinks, and any other objects which become associated with Him, are all nirgun. A person, who realises Bhagvan's svarup in this way, does not have any affection for the panch-vishays, just like I do not. He becomes independent.
13.10 "It is this Purushottam, who is greater than Akshar, and who is the cause of all avatars. All avatars originate from Purushottam, and they merge back into Purushottam. When Bhagvan leaves this earth to return to His dham after assuming a human svarup, sometimes His physical body remains on earth like a human being – like when Rukmani took Shree Krishna's body into her lap and was engulfed along with it in the fire. Similarly, Rushabh- Dev's body was burnt in a raging forest fire. In other instances, His bones and flesh become divya, and He returns to His dham without leaving behind any remains. When He incarnates, He may sometimes be born of a woman, or He may sometimes appear from whatever He wishes. In this way, Bhagvan's method of birth and death are not always in accordance with the ways of this world. When you thoroughly realise Bhagvan in this way, you will come across no obstacles on the path of kalyan. Without this firm understanding of the nature of Bhagvan, a person will never be able to overcome his weakness, regardless of the amount of tyag he maintains or the number of upvas he performs.
13.11 "Then you may say, 'We have firm understanding of that Bhagvan just as you have described. Then, why do our prans and indriyas not become engaged in Bhagvan?' Well, a person should understand that as being Bhagvan's wish. In reality, such a person has nothing left to accomplish; he is fulfilled and has reached the end of all spiritual activities. If a person has a firm belief in Bhagvan, then even if there is a slight flaw in remaining nirmani, nirlobhi, nishkami, nisvadi, or nisnehi, there is still nothing to worry about. However, if any deficiency remains in understanding Bhagvan, then that flaw will never be eradicated. Therefore, a person should attempt to understand this principle by any means within this lifetime.
13.12 "If a person has completely understood the essence of this talk, then regardless of whether a person is reborn in a lower or higher life-form due to his prarabdha karmas, like Vrutrasur, he will not forget this gnan. Also, when Bharatji was reborn as a deer, he retained gnan from his previous life. That is the profound greatness of this gnan. In fact, it is even narrated continuously in the sabhas of sadhus such as Narad, the Sanakadik, and Brahma and other devs.
13.13 "However, talks regarding the nature of Bhagvan cannot be understood by a person on his own; not even from the shastras. Even though these facts may be in the shastras, it is only when the sat-purush manifests on this earth, and a person hears them being narrated to him, that he understands them. However, they cannot be understood by a person's intellect alone, even from the shastras.
13.14 "A person who has completely understood the svarup of Bhagvan, and who is also able to see the past, present, and future, still does not have the slightest pride regarding this fact. He would not grant anyone a vardan, and nor would he curse anyone; but sometimes, he may grant a vardan or give a curse. At times, he remains fearless, and at other times, he may even become frightened. Despite that, he would never allow emotions such as happiness or depression to come into his mind. A person who has such an unflinching refuge of Bhagvan would never knowingly perform a bad deed. However, if due to unpleasant circumstances an improper deed is performed, a person with such a refuge would still not fall from the path of kalyan. Therefore, there is no other obstacle-free path like that of having the firm refuge of Bhagvan.
13.15 "A person who has understood this fact, has only pure intentions. I have absolutely no selfish expectations from my paramhans and satsangis. The only reason I may call someone, lecture someone, or send someone away, is that if by any means a person realises this fact; it will be very beneficial to them. So, all of you should firmly remember this talk.
13.16 "Also, you should all understand that the murti amidst the divine light is this Maharaj visible before you. If you cannot do that, then at least realise, 'Maharaj sees the murti which is amidst that akshar-rup light'. Even if you can understand this much, you will be able to maintain love for me. As a result, you will attain atyantik kalyan. Keep this principle constantly new and fresh in your minds; never forget it out of pride. Remember it tomorrow just as it is today. Keep it vivid in your minds and remember it daily until the end of your lives. Whenever you talk about Bhagvan, be sure to implant the seeds of this principle. This is my agna. Moreover, this principle is so vital that you should remember it daily for the rest of your lives. In fact, even after you leave this body and attain a divya svarup, you should recall it. This principle, which I have revealed before you, is the very essence of all the shastras, and it is my own firm experience. I have talked to you having seen it with my very own eyes. In fact, I take oath on all of you paramhans that I have seen these facts with my own eyes."
13.17 In this way, Shreeji Maharaj indirectly described His true identity as Purushottam. Upon hearing this revelation, the sadhus and bhaktas accepted the fact that the murti described amidst the divine light is, in fact, Shreeji Maharaj Himself.

Nirvikalp Samadhi
14.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Bhadarva sud 1 [28th August 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on veranda outside the north-facing rooms near the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes, and had covered Himself with a white chadar. Around His head, He had tied a white feto in which a chhoglu of red karnikar flowers had been inserted. A beautiful, kum-kum chandlo also adorned His forehead. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
14.2 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "When a sadhu attains oneness with the svarup of Bhagvan, does he attain it through samadhi, or can he also attain it through some other method?"
14.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Once a person has known that this is a neem tree, he never has the doubt in his mind, 'Is this a neem tree, or not?' Similarly, if a person has a total understanding of Bhagvan's svarup as I described yesterday, if he no longer has any doubts about it, and if his mind in no way causes his belief of Bhagvan to waver regardless of the type of company he may encounter or the type of shastras he may hear, then such absolute nishchay is what I call oneness.
14.4 "Such oneness is attained through profound association with an ekantik bhakta of Bhagvan, but not by samadhi alone. In fact, such oneness is itself nirvikalp samadhi. Moreover, the sadhu who has such nirvikalp samadhi is also called nirgun brahm. Regardless of whether he follows the path of nirvrutti or the path of pravrutti, the sadhu who has such an unshakeable nishchay is still nirgun. For example, Narad and the Sanakadik all followed the path of nivrutti, whereas the Sapta Rushis, and Janak Raja, all followed the path of pravrutti. However, due to their nishchay in Bhagvan, they should all be known to be nirgun.
14.5 "However, those who follow the path of nivrutti, but do not have nishchay in Bhagvan, should be known to be sagun due to their mayik qualities. Furthermore, a person should realise, 'This person appears to be a strict tyagi, but because he does not have the belief of Bhagvan, he is ignorant and will definitely go to Narak'.
14.6 "On the other hand, a person who has nishchay in Bhagvan will not attain an unpleasant fate – even if some small deficiency remains in him. In fact, ultimately, he will definitely attain the nirgun state. But, a person without this belief of Bhagvan – even if he is a sincere tyagi and is vigilantly striving to eradicate kam, krodh, and lobh, – will not be able to eradicate those vicious natures by his efforts alone. Ultimately, he will become evil and go to Narak.
14.7 "Therefore, whoever has attained such gnan of Bhagvan, even if he has only a weak intellect, should still be regarded as possessing great intellect. On the other hand, if he has not attained such gnan of Bhagvan, then even if he has great intellect, he should still be known as having no intellect."

Gadhada II – 15
Keeping Hatred Towards The Svabhavs
15.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Bhadarva sud 2 [29th August 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a square cushion which had been placed on the veranda outside the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
15.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked all the paramhans a question: "There is a single thought which can destroy any svabhav, regardless of how difficult it may be. Without that thought, the svabhav cannot be eradicated even if a person were to apply a thousand other thoughts. What is that thought? Please answer according to your understanding."
15.3 The paramhans replied according to their understanding, but none were able to give a complete explanation.
15.4 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "I shall explain. If a person's enemy were to ruin whatever work he is doing, or if he were to swear at his mother or sister, then he would have an intense hatred for him and would employ any means whatsoever to harm him. If not that, he would at least be extremely happy if someone else were to harm him. In the very same way, if the inner enemies, such as kam and krodh, obstruct a person while he is striving to attain kalyan, he would hold the same sort of hatred towards them as well; and that hatred would never diminish. Whoever applies such a thought can eradicate all svabhavs with that thought alone.
15.5 "Now, if a sadhu were to criticise and insult those inner enemies, then a person who had the previously mentioned thought would not develop a hatred towards that sadhu; he would be grateful to the sadhu and would feel, 'This sadhu is helping me conquer my enemy, and therefore he is an extremely great friend'. A person who has attained such a thought can destroy all of his inner enemies. As a result, no vicious svabhavs will be able to remain in his heart. Without this thought, the inner enemies ( svabhavs) can never be overpowered, regardless of whichever types of other thoughts may be applied. Therefore, keeping hatred towards the svabhavs is the greatest thought of all."
15.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "By which characteristics can someone recognise a person who would never deflect from the four attributes of dharma, vairagya, gnan of the atma, and bhakti of Bhagvan coupled with knowledge of His greatness?"
15.7 All the sadhus attempted to answer the question according to their understanding, but no one was able to give a precise answer.
15.8 So, Shreeji Maharaj explained, "From childhood, if a person has such a nature that he would never be suppressed by anyone's personality, nor could anyone mock someone or joke in his presence, nor could anyone make even a mild sarcastic comment at him, then such a person would never deflect from dharma, vairagya, gnan, and the bhakti of Bhagvan. Even though his personality may make him appear arrogant, because of his enthusiasm to attain kalyan, he will not leave satsang under any circumstances."

Gadhada II – 16
Faith In Bhagvan And Faith In Dharma
16.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Bhadarva sud 10 [7th September 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a wooden bench near the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
16.2 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "Some may have nishchay in Bhagvan, like Arjun, and others may have nishchay in dharma, like Yudhishthir. Of these two, if a person attempts to maintain faith in Bhagvan, faith in dharma may decline; and if a person attempts to maintain faith in dharma, faith in Bhagvan may decline. So, what method can a person use so that neither of the two declines?"
16.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The first skandh of Shreemad Bhagvat includes a discussion between Pruthvi and Dharma, which mentions that Bhagvan possesses the thirty-nine kalyan-kari characteristics, such as truthfulness and purity. Therefore, all forms of dharma are supported by the murti of Bhagvan. This is why Bhagvan is called dharma-dhurandhar (the upholder of dharma).
16.4 "Also, in the first skandh of the Shreemad Bhagvat, the Sanakadik rushis ask Sutpurani, 'In whom did dharma seek refuge after Shree Krishna Bhagvan – who was the shield for dharma – reverted to His dham?' Therefore, dharma takes refuge only in Bhagvan's murti. That is why when a person keeps faith in Bhagvan's murti, Bhagvan comes and dwells in that person's heart. As a result, dharma also dwells in his heart. Therefore, faith in dharma naturally develops in a person who possesses faith in Bhagvan. However, if a person maintains faith in dharma alone, then faith in Bhagvan will decline. It is for this reason that a person who is intelligent should certainly maintain firm faith in Bhagvan; and as a result faith in dharma will also remain firm."
16.5 Then, Muktanand Swami asked another question: "Can the desires for the panch-vishays be conquered by vairagya, or can they be conquered by other means?"
16.6 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "Whether or not a person has vairagya, if he attentively follows the niyams prescribed by Bhagvan, then the desires for the panch-vishays can be conquered.
16.7 "With vairagya, a great deal of effort is required to withdraw a person's vrutti from sounds; and even then, the ears can still hear. However, if the ears are simply plugged, then naturally no sound will be heard. Similarly, if a person does not touch anything inappropriate, he automatically conquers touch. In the same way, if he does not look at anything improper, he automatically conquers sight. Also, when there is delicious food, if he mixes it together and adds water to it, and he controls his diet, then the sense of taste will automatically be conquered. If he blocks his nose when there is an attractive smell, he also automatically conquers the sense of smell. In this way, the panch-vishays can be conquered by following niyams. However, if a person does not follow these niyams, then regardless of how intense his vairagya may be, or how much gnan he may possess, he will not remain stable in any way. Therefore, the only way to overcome the desires for the panch-vishays is to follow the niyams prescribed by Bhagvan. Furthermore, for those who have little vairagya, remaining within niyams is the only way of being saved, just as an ill person can only be cured if he controls his diet and completes his course of medication."
16.8 Then, Akhandanand Swami asked, "An ill person has a fixed number of days over which he must follow his course of medication. Similarly, is there a definite time period for which a person must make an effort to attain kalyan?"
16.9 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "It takes a person who has weak shraddha many lives to reach the highest point of his spiritual activities. In fact, the Bhagvad Geeta states: anek-janma-sansiddh-stato yati param gatim" This shlok explains that only a yogi who has become siddh after many lives, attains Akshardham. This has been said for those who have less shraddha.
16.10 "In comparison, a person who has strong shraddha becomes enlightened immediately. This is also mentioned in the Bhagvad Geeta: shraddhavan-labhate gnanam tat-paraha sanyatendriyaha gnanam labdhva param shantima-chirena-dhigach-chhati" The meaning of this shlok is, 'A person whose indriyas are under control and who also possesses shraddha, attains gnan. Upon attaining that gnan, such a person immediately attains Akshardham'. Therefore, a person who has intense shraddha reaches the highest point of his spiritual activities sooner, whereas a person who has weak shraddha reaches that state after many lives. For example, if a man is going to Kashi, but walks only two steps throughout day, it will obviously take him many days to reach Kashi. On the other hand, if he starts walking twenty miles a day, it will take him only a few days to reach Kashi. In the same way, if a person has intense shraddha, then even if he has only recently become a satsangi, he will still become great. Conversely, a person who has little shraddha, even though he may have joined satsang a long time ago, still remains weak."
16.11 Then, Shree Gurucharanratanand Swami asked, "If those who have less shraddha attain kalyan after many lives, where do they stay until then?"
16.12 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "They go and reside in the beautiful loks of the devs. This is because when that bhakta performed dhyan on Bhagvan, he used to look towards Bhagvan, and Bhagvan used to look towards him as well. However, Bhagvan was aware of the vishays the bhakta thought about and had affection for while performing dhyan on Him. Therefore, when the bhakta leaves his body, Bhagvan sends him to a lok full of the vishays for which he had a passion. Bhagvan also issues the following command to Kal: 'You should not interfere in this bhakta's indulgence in the vishays'. As a result, that bhakta remains in the loks of the devs and enjoys those pleasures. Then, when he returns to Mrutyu-Lok, he eventually attains kalyan after many lives."
16.13 Akhandanand Swami then asked another question: "What are the characteristics of a person who possesses intense shraddha?"
16.14 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Whenever a person with intense shraddha wants to engage in an activity related to Bhagvan – such as going for the darshan of Bhagvan, or listening to talks and kathas related to Bhagvan, or performing His mansi puja – then to be able to do so, he would become very quick in carrying out his bodily activities, such as bathing. Also, if I were to write a letter changing a particular vartman, he would be eager to abide by it. In addition, even if he were a senior person, he would become as impatient as a child to have the darshan of Bhagvan. A person who has such characteristics should be known as a person who possesses intense shraddha.
16.15 "A person who has such shraddha is able to immediately conquer all of his indriyas. However, the indriyas of a person, who has little shraddha on the path of Bhagvan, are extremely attached to the vishays. Moreover, no matter how hard he tries to hide it, everyone still realises the fact that this person's indriyas are extremely attached towards the vishays."
16.16 Then, Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The indriyas are like the wind even though the wind cannot be seen, it can be assumed that the wind is blowing by the way in which it shakes the trees. Similarly, the vruttis of the indriyas cannot be seen, but everyone realises that they flow towards the vishays. If a person deceitfully attempts to hide this, then realising him to be deceitful, others will criticise him even more. Therefore, in no way can a person conceal that intense craving of his indriyas to indulge in the vishays."
16.17 Muktanand Swami then asked, "How can those intense cravings of the indriyas to indulge in the vishays be eradicated?"
16.18 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The only means to eradicate the intensity of the indriyas is to force the indriyas to follow the niyams for tyagis and grahasthas as prescribed by Bhagvan. As a result, the intensity of the indriyas automatically diminishes. When a person does not allow the five indriyas (the ears, the skin, the eyes, the tongue, and the nose) to wander, the diet of the indriyas becomes pure, after which the antah-karans become pure as well. Therefore, regardless of whether a person possesses intense vairagya or not, if he conquers his indriyas and keeps them within the niyams prescribed by Bhagvan, he can conquer the desires for the vishays more thoroughly than a person with intense vairagya. Therefore, a person should firmly abide by the niyams prescribed by Bhagvan."
16.19 Akhandanand Swami asked again, "If a person has weak shraddha, how can it become stronger?"
16.20 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a person can realise the greatness of Bhagvan then even if he has weak shraddha, it will grow stronger. For example, a person would never be attracted to clay utensils that are used for drinking water. However, if those utensils were made of gold, then he would naturally be attracted to them. Similarly, if he realises the greatness of the talks and kirtans related to Bhagvan, then his shraddha in Bhagvan and in those activities will naturally increase. Therefore, a person should use whichever method is necessary to understand the greatness of Bhagvan. If he does use such a method, then even if he has no shraddha at all, he will develop shraddha; and if he has weak shraddha, it will become stronger."

Tattvas In The Svarup Of Bhagvan - Sthitapragna
17.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on the night of aso vad 11 [21st October 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a sinhasan on the veranda outside the rooms near the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Two torches were lit in front of Him. While kirtans were being sung, a sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
17.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please stop the kirtans now, and let us begin a question-answer discussion."
17.3 Then, all the munis replied, "Very well, Maharaj."
17.4 Shreeji Maharaj then raised a question: "Some bhaktas understand the svarup of Bhagvan as being composed of the twenty-four tattvas of Maya, while some understand it as being composed purely of chaitanya and free of mayik elements. Of these two types of bhaktas, whose understanding is correct, and whose understanding is incorrect?"
17.5 Muktanand Swami replied, "The understanding of a person who considers Bhagvan's svarup as being composed of the twenty-four mayik elements is incorrect. The understanding of a person who considers Bhagvan's svarup as being composed purely of chaitanya, and free of mayik tattvas, is correct."
17.6 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Followers of the Sankhya philosophy claim that there are twenty-four tattvas. According to that philosophy, there are twenty-three tattvas, and the twenty-fourth is kshetragna – in the form of jeev and ishvar – which is composed of chaitanya. The twenty-four tattva have been described in this way. This is because kshetra and kshetragna have a mutual dependence on each other. Without kshetragna, kshetra cannot be described, and without kshetra, kshetragna cannot be described. For this reason, jeev and ishvar have been included with the elements, while Bhagvan has been described as the refuge of both kshetra and kshetragna. In this case, how can the mayik tattvas be described as being distinct from Bhagvan? For example, four tattvas reside within akash, yet akash is unaffected by any of their flaws. In the same way, not a single flaw of the mayik tattvas influences the svarup of Bhagvan. So, what is the inconsistency in believing that Bhagvan's svarup is composed of the twenty-four tattvas? Does claiming 'Bhagvan's svarup is not composed of the tattvas' prevent inconsistencies? This is how I understand it."
17.7 Then, Dina-Nath Bhatt asked, "Should a person who wishes to perform dhyan on Bhagvan's svarup understand it as being composed of the tattvas or understand it as not being composed of the tattvas?"
17.8 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person who understands Bhagvan's svarup as being composed of the tattvas, is a sinner; and a person who understands Bhagvan's svarup as not being composed of the tattvas is also a sinner. Those who are bhaktas of Bhagvan do not at all like to senselessly quibble over whether or not Bhagvan's svarup is composed of the tattvas. A bhaktas realises, 'Bhagvan is Bhagvan. There is no scope for dividing or discarding any part of Him. That very Bhagvan is the atma of countless brahmands'. A person who has no doubts at all regarding the nature of Bhagvan should be known to have attained the nirvikalp state. A person with such stable understanding should be known as 'sthitapragna'. Moreover, Bhagvan redeems all the sins of a person who has such stable understanding regarding Bhagvan.
17.9 "In the Bhagvad Geeta, Bhagvan has said to Arjun, sarva-dharman-parityajya mame-kam sharanam vraja aham tvam sarva-papebhyo mokshayi-shyami ma shuchaha : Abandon all other forms of dharma and surrender only unto me. I shall deliver you from all sins; so do not grieve.
17.10 "In fact, it is a usual custom in this world that an intelligent person will not notice a fault in someone who serves his major self-interests. For example, to serve her self-interest, a woman will not notice any faults in her husband. This also applies to other grahasthas who do not notice the faults in their relatives, if they have intense self-interest in them. In the same way, if a person realises that Bhagvan serves his own self-interest – Bhagvan relieves His bhaktas of their sins and ignorance and grants them kalyan – then he will never perceive avgun in Bhagvan in any way.
17.11 "For example, when Shukji narrated the ras- leela, Parikshit Raja raised the following doubt: 'Why did Bhagvan associate with other women?' However, Shukji did not have the slightest doubt. Even the gopis, with whom Bhagvan engaged in romantic actions, did not doubt by thinking, 'If He is Bhagvan, why does He behave like this?' They did not have any such doubts. Moreover, when Bhagvan went to the home of Kubja, He took Uddhavji along with Him, yet Uddhavji did not have any doubts at all. Also, when Uddhavji was sent to Vraj, he still did not have any doubts on hearing the words of the gopis. Instead, he greatly realised the greatness of the gopis.
17.12 "Therefore, the understanding of a person who has developed an unwavering refuge of Bhagvan will not become distorted, regardless of whether he is very educated in the shastras, or he is naïve. Also, the greatness of a loyal bhakta of Bhagvan can only be realised by a person who is a bhakta of Bhagvan. Regardless of whether a person is educated in the shastras or is naïve, only a person with a firm understanding of Bhagvan realises the greatness of a bhakta of Bhagvan, and only he recognises a bhakta possessing a firm understanding. On the other hand, vimukhs in the world, regardless of whether they are pandits or fools, are unable to develop such firm understanding of Bhagvan. Moreover, they do not recognise a bhakta possessing a firm understanding, and nor do they realise the greatness of a bhakta of Bhagvan. Therefore, only a bhakta of Bhagvan can recognise another bhakta of Bhagvan, and only he can realise his greatness. For example, Uddhavji realised the profound greatness of the gopis. Likewise, the gopis realised the greatness of Uddhavji.
17.13 "Although Purushottam Bhagvan is the kshetragna of all kshetragnas, He is still not subject to change. Moreover, the disturbances of objects that cause disturbances – such as Maya – do not influence Purushottam Bhagvan. In fact, if the disturbances of sthul, sukshma, and karan do not influence a person who has realised the atma, what can be said about them not influencing Purushottam Bhagvan? Therefore, Bhagvan is certainly not subject to change; He is absolutely unaffected.
17.14 "A bhakta of Bhagvan who understands Bhagvan's svarup in this way should be known to be 'sthitapragna'. Just as a person who has realised his atma is called 'sthitapragna', a bhakta of Bhagvan who has no doubts at all regarding the svarup of Bhagvan, and glorifies His strengths, is also called 'sthitapragna'. He also glorifies those charitras of Bhagvan that appear to be inappropriate, in exactly the same way that he glorifies charitras that are appropriate – without having any doubts about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of those charitras. Such a bhakta should be known as being 'sthitapragna' with regards to the nature of Purushottam. A person who has developed such a firm belief of the nature of Purushottam has nothing more left to understand."

Gadhada II – 18
Nastik And Shushka- Vedanti
18.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Magshar vad 6 [7th December 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow that had been placed in His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes, and had covered Himself with a white chadar, over which He had wrapped a richly embroidered rajai. He had also tied a white feto around His head. At that time, Pragji Davé was reading a shastra before Him, and a sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
18.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Having thought over it from all aspects, I have come to the following conclusion: Of all the kusang in the world, the kusang which is worse than all others is that of those who do not have bhakti towards Bhagvan. Also, they do not have the faith in their hearts that Bhagvan loves His bhaktas, is the lord of all, is patit-pavan, and is also adham- udharan. In this world, two thoughts share these beliefs: One is that of the nastiks, and the other is that of the shushka- vedantis. Both are extreme forms of kusang. Now, even if a person has committed the five great sins, but he has faith in Bhagvan, then at some time or another he will be redeemed. In fact, even if a person has committed the great sins of killing a child, slaughtering a cow, or killing a woman, then he too can be redeemed at some point in time. However, a person who has come to accept either of these two sets of beliefs will never be redeemed. This is because such a person's understanding is contrary to that of the Veds, the six-shastras, and the Purans.
18.3 "Of the two, the nastiks believe that Ramchandraji and Shree Krishna Bhagvan were actually only kings; and because Shree Krishna killed demons and committed adultery, he has been sent to the third Narak. Therefore, in no way do they consider Shree Krishna Bhagvan, who is patit- pavan and adham- udharan, as being Bhagvan. Instead, they believe their kalyan to be through karmas. They believe that while performing karmas, they attain keval- gnan, and become Bhagvan. In this way, they believe that there are countless Bhagvans. So, according to the belief of the nastiks, there is no one, eternal Bhagvan, by whose worship a jeev is released from the bondage of births and deaths. Therefore, that belief is not in accordance with the Veds.
18.4 "The shushka- vedantis believe that brahm itself has assumed the svarup of the jeevs – just as in the relationship between the sun and its reflection. Therefore, when a person realises 'I am brahm', he has no further spiritual activities left to perform. Then, when he has become Bhagvan, he does not need to worship anyone. Thinking this, they no longer have fear in committing sins. Moreover, they believe, 'We have attained the nirgun path, so we will not have to take birth again'. However, the shushka-vedantis do not examine their own understanding which implies that nirgun brahm, which is beyond Maya, will also have to pass through births and deaths. This is because they claim that brahm itself has assumed the svarup of all sthavar and jangam objects. This means that just as a jeev has to undergo births and deaths, brahm also has to undergo births and deaths. Also, while they think, 'We will be released from births and deaths', they do not realise, 'According to our own beliefs, births and deaths have become a reality for brahm itself. Therefore, if we do develop deep understanding, at most we shall realise ourselves to be brahm-svarup. But even then, the cycle of births and deaths will still not be dispelled'. As a result, by their own beliefs, moksh is proven false. Nevertheless, no one examines this. Instead, they boast, 'We are brahm-svarup, so who do we need to worship? Who do we bow to?' Thinking this, they become extremely arrogant. Even though they have not truly understood anything, they still have pride of their gnan. However, they do not realise that their own moksh is proven false by their own beliefs. Moreover, they convert those who keep their company into fools as well.
18.5 "However, bhaktas possessing true gnan, such as Narad, the Sanakadik, and Shukji, constantly perform dhyan upon Bhagvan, chant His holy name, and sing kirtans. Even the niranna- muktas in Shvet-Dvip, who are brahm- svarup and who can control Kal, continuously perform dhyan upon Bhagvan, chant His holy name, and sing kirtans about Him. They also offer puja, smear sandalwood paste on Him, and perform dandvats. Despite being akshar-rup, they behave as the das of Purushottam Bhagvan. Also, the residents of Badrikashram, including Uddhav, Tanu Rushi, and the other munis, perform tap and continuously offer bhakti to Bhagvan. On the other hand, the shushka- vedantis are completely oriented around their bodies. Also, they do not perform dhyan upon Bhagvan, nor do they chant the name of Bhagvan, and nor do they bow before Bhagvan. Compared to the power and gnan of Narad, the Sanakadik, and Shukji; and compared to the power and gnan of the niranna- muktas who reside in Shvet-Dvip; and compared to the power and gnan of the rushis who reside in Badrikashram, these shushka- vedantis do not possess even a millionth of a fraction of such power and gnan. Nevertheless, they equate themselves with Bhagvan. Therefore, they are absolutely ignorant. In fact, they are the most ignorant of all ignorant people. Even after spending countless millions of years in the pits of Narak suffering the torments of Yam, they will still not be released.
18.6 "Therefore, to associate with such people is the very definition of kusang. Just as there is no deed greater than keeping the company of the sat- purush, conversely, there is no sin worse than keeping the company of ignorant people such as the shushka- vedantis. Therefore, a person who desires moksh should in no way keep the company of a nastik or a shushka- vedanti."

Gadhada II – 19
Distress After Hearing Shushka- Vedanti Shastras - Letter To The Haribhaktas
19.1 In the Samvat year 1878, at daybreak on Magshar vad 14 [23rd December 1821], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj arrived at the residential hall of the paramhans in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. In an unhappy mood, He sat down on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow. He refused to talk to anyone, or even look at anyone. The white feto tied around His head had loosened and become undone, yet He paid no attention to it. In this way, He sat extremely unhappy for a while. Tears then begun to flow from His eyes.
19.2 Then, addressing the paramhans, Shreeji Maharaj said, "To learn about the beliefs of those possessing shushka- gnan, I listened to their shastras. However, simply hearing them has caused much grief in my heart. This is because by listening to the shushka- vedanti shastras, the upasana of Bhagvan is dispelled from the mind, and a sense of equality arises in a person's heart, and he begins to worship devs. By listening to the words of those shushka- vedantis, a person's mind becomes extremely corrupted. Even though I listened to the principles of shushka- vedanti with a specific purpose, doing so has brought me much grief."
19.3 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj became very unhappy, and sat in silence with His heart filled with sorrow. After remaining disheartened for a long time, He wiped the tears from His eyes with His hands and said, "I went to sleep last night after listening to Ramanuj's commentary on the Bhagvad Geeta. I had a dream in which I went to Golok, where I saw countless parshads of Bhagvan. Of these, some serve Bhagvan, and they appear to be very still. Others sing kirtans of Bhagvan, including kirtans composed by Muktanand Swami and Brahmanand Swami. In the process of singing kirtans, they sway in the same way as a person who sings and sways in euphoria due to intoxication. Then, I also joined those who were singing and began to sing kirtans. While singing, the following thought arose: 'A person who shuns such loving bhakti and upasana of Bhagvan, and claims to possess gnan, and believes, 'I myself am Bhagvan', is extremely wicked'."
19.4 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Let us write a letter to send to the satsangis in various places so that they never lapse in observing dharma and in offering bhakti to Bhagvan in any way, and so that their mind is never dislodged from this ishta- dev, Shree Krishna- Narayan.
19.5 "' Written by Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj. All paramhans and all satsangis – male and female – please accept sincerest 'Narayan' from me. I am issuing the following as my agna: The avatar of Shree Krishna-Narayan – Purushottam Bhagvan – incarnates among humans and devs, for the purpose of establishing dharma, uprooting adharma, and giving darshan to and protecting His ekantik bhaktas who possess the four qualities (dharma in the form of brahm-charya and ahinsa, atma-nistha, vairagya, and bhakti coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness). Therefore, a person should have a singular belief of that avatar – just as Sitaji was convinced that Ramchandraji was flawless. A person should also lovingly perform the mansi puja of that Bhagvan and physically offer to Him the nine types of bhakti. If that avatar of Shree Krishna-Narayan is not present on this earth, then he should perform puja of His murti mentally and also physically by offering sandalwood paste, tulsi, flowers, and other similar offerings.
19.6 "Moreover, he should offer upasana only to Bhagvan and not to any dev; if he does, it is a great sin. In this way, his vow of fidelity is lost and his bhakti becomes like that of a prostitute. Therefore, a person should offer bhakti to Bhagvan in the way of Sita and Rukmani. He should perform dhyan only on that Bhagvan and not on any dev, and nor should he perform dhyan on a sadhu, even if he has attained an elevated state and mastered samadhi.
19.7 "Furthermore, all should strictly abide by the dharma of their varna and ashram. All men who firmly abide by this agna of mine will develop firm bhakti towards Shree Krishna Narayan like that of Narad. All women who accept this injunction of mine will develop firm bhakti towards Shree Krishna-Narayan, like that of Lakshmiji and the gopis, such as Radhikaji. Conversely, the bhakti of those who do not accept these words of mine will become like that of a prostitute.
19.8 "Written on Magshar vad 14, Samvat 1878'."
19.9 After writing this letter, Shreeji Maharaj had it sent to all satsang is residing in various places.

Gadhada II – 20
The Sense Of Knowing And The Strength Of the Indriyas
20.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Posh vad 14 [22nd January 1822], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chofal, above which He Had wrapped a rajai made of chhint. He had also tied a white pagh around His head. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the paramhans were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a mrudang.
20.2 Then, addressing the paramhans, Shreeji Maharaj said, "At my residence today, I asked a question to Somla Khachar and the other bhaktas who stay with me. I would like all the paramhans to get together and answer that question."
20.3 The paramhans requested, "Maharaj, may we please hear that question."
20.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A person who masters samadhi attains a spiritual state that is beyond maya. He also has firm bond with the svarup of Bhagvan. Therefore, the person's mental ability, as well as the strength of his body and indriyas, should increase. This is because the twenty-four tattvas, which have been produced from Maya, have a form that is both jad and chaitanya; they cannot be said to be only jad, nor can they be said to be only chaitanya. Also, the strength in each of the elements cannot be said to be equal. There is a greater degree of awareness in the antah-karans than there is in the indriyas. Likewise, there is a greater degree of awareness in the jeev – the drashta of the indriyas and antah-karans – than there is in the antah-karans.
20.5 "When the jeev experiences samadhi, it abandons its role as the drashta of the indriyas and antah-karans; and like Brahm, that jeev becomes chaitanya, and its bond with the svarup of Bhagvan is maintained. Now, regarding those who have mastered samadhi, some people think, 'Whoever experiences samadhi, loses even the knowledge he had previously'. So, do the mental ability and the strength of the body and indriyas of a person who has mastered samadhi increase or not? That is the question."
20.6 The paramhans then answered according to their intellect, but no one was able to give an adequate answer to Shreeji Maharaj's question.
20.7 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I will answer. The answer to the question is that Brahm, who is the witness, enters the brahmand – which is composed of the twenty-four tattvas, and which was produced from Maya – and makes it chaitanya. This gives it the power to perform all activities. The nature of that Brahm is such that when it enters an object that is as jad as wood or stone, that object becomes an object that can move. When the jeev becomes one with that Brahm through samadhi, then that jeev can also be said to be brahm-rup. As a result, its gnan also increases.
20.8 "With regards to the strength of the indriyas, a person who practices yog, coupled with tap, nivrutti dharma, and vairagya, attains siddh- dasha like that of Shukji. On the other hand, there may be a person whose tap, observance of nivrutti dharma, and vairagya are at an ordinary level, and who follows the path of pravrutti in the form of dharma, arth, and kam. In his case, although he may experience samadhi, only his gnan will increase, but the strength of his indriyas does not increase and he does not attain siddh-dasha. In fact, even though a person may possess gnan like Janak Raja, those who follow the path of pravrutti do not attain siddh-dasha like Narad, the Sanakadik, and Shukji. On the other hand, a person who has attained siddh-dasha can travel to all places in this lok and beyond. However, for those who follow the path of pravrutti, like Janak Raja, only their gnan increases; but it does not decrease.
20.9 "In fact, what happens is described by Shree Krishna Bhagvan in the Geeta in the shlok: ya nisha sarva-bhootanam tasyam jagarti sayyamee yasyam jagrati bhootani sa nisha pashyato munehe "The meaning of this shlok is: 'A self-controlled person is awake to that which all other beings are asleep; and that to which all other beings are awake, a self-controlled person is asleep'. Specifically, a person whose vision is facing inwards towards the atma has no regard to his body, indriyas, or antah-karans. On seeing this, a person who is ignorant thinks, 'The gnan of a person who experiences samadhi decreases'. As a result, if a person under the influence of rajo-gun, tamo-gun, or impure sattva-gun attempts to answer this question, then he would certainly think that the gnan of a person who experiences samadhi does decrease. However, he does not realise, 'I constantly believe myself to be the body and am speaking out of foolishness'.
20.10 "Therefore, the gnan of a person who experiences samadhi still increases even though he behaves distinctly from the body, indriyas, and antah-karans. Even after he returns to the indriyas and antah-karans, the gnan obtained during samadhi is still not destroyed. As for a person who takes up tap, nivrutti dharma, and vairagya – after abandoning the path of pravrutti – just as his gnan has increased, the strength of his indriyas and antah-karans will increase as well. Also, he will attain siddh- dasha like Narad, the Sanakadik, and Shukji."

Gadhada II – 21
Bhagvan Is The Cause Of All
21.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Fagan sud Punam [7th March 1822], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a white pagh around His head. Premanand Swami and other paramhans were singing vishnupad before Him.
21.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please stop the kirtans. I wish to speak to all of you, so please listen attentively." He then said, "I have listened to all the shastras written by Vyasji regarding the attainment of kalyan. The main principle prevalent in all those shastras and the only principle for the kalyan of the jeev is simply this: Bhagvan creates, maintains, and destroys this entire universe.
21.3 "Also, in all of those shastras, there are talks of the charitras of either Bhagvan or His sant. So, a person cannot attain kalyan just by following the dharma of his varna and ashram, or through its rewards in the form of dharma, arth, and kam. This is because the observance of the dharma on its own may bring worldly reputation and physical comforts – but that is all. However, to attain kalyan, a person must realise Bhagvan to be the all-doer.
21.4 "In addition, nothing remains to be understood on the path of kalyan if a person realises the greatness of pratyaksha Bhagvan and His sant in exactly the same way as he realises the greatness of past avatars of Bhagvan such as Ram, and Krishna, and the greatness of past sadhus, such as Narad, the Sanakadik, Shukji, Jadbharat, Hanuman, and Uddhav.
21.5 "Whether this principle is understood after being told once, or after being told a thousand times; whether it is understood today, or after a thousand years, there is no option but to understand it. If a person were to ask Narad, the Sanakadik, Shukji, Brahma, and Shiv, as they are wise, even they would point to pratyaksha Bhagvan and the pratyaksha sant as being the only granters of kalyan. They would also explain that the greatness of the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan and the pratyaksha sant is exactly the same as the greatness of past svarup of Bhagvan and His sant.
21.6 "A person who has such a firm nishchay, has grasped all the fundamental principles. What is more, he will never fall from the path of kalyan. Brahma, Shiv, Bruhaspati, Parashar, and many others may have fallen from the path of dharma due to vicious natures like k am and krodh, but because they had the same nishchay and knowledge of the greatness of pratyaksha Bhagvan and the pratyaksha sant as they had of their past lives, they did not fall from the path of kalyan. Therefore, this very fact is the essence of all the shastras."
21.7 In the evening of that same day, Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj mounted His horse in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada and came to Lakshmi-Vadi. There, He sat on a decorated bedstead on the platform under the mango tree. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a white pagh around His head, with a tassel of yellow flowers hanging from it. Bunches of mogra flowers were placed upon His ears, and a garland of mogra flowers was hanging around His neck. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
21.8 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please listen, I wish to ask all of you a question. During the svapna state, when the jeev sees a creation and indulges in the pleasures of that creation, does the jeev itself become the svarup of the creation? Or does the jeev create the creation in its svapna by its own will? Also, in the same way as the jeev, the ishvars also experience creations during their svapna state. Do they themselves become the svarup of the creation? Or do they create it by their own will? Or does Bhagvan, who is beyond both jeev and ishvar, create the creations experienced in their svapnas?"
21.9 Everyone attempted to answer the question according to his level of intelligence, but no one was able to offer a precise explanation.
21.10 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "Neither the jeev nor ishvar creates the creations experienced during the svapna state, and nor do they become the svarup of those creations themselves. In reality, it is Bhagvan – who is beyond both jeev and ishvar, and who is also the giver of the rewards of a person's karmas – who creates the world experienced in svapnas according to the karmas of the particular jeev or ishvar.
21.11 "The unstable and deceptive nature of svapnas is due to their region of origin. The throat is a place where countless types of such creations can be seen – just as when an oil lamp is lit in one place within a mandir decorated with mirrors, countless oil lamps would be seen. Therefore, due to the location of its origin (the throat), a single thought can be experienced in countless ways."
21.12 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "A person possessing gnan understands only the influence of desh to be predominant when there is the predominance of desh; when the influence of kal is predominant, he understands only kal to be predominant; when the influence of karma is predominant, he understands only karma to be predominant; and when Bhagvan's influence is predominant, he understand only Bhagvan to be predominant. In contrast, a fool, once he has understood one factor, considers that alone to be the main principle. If he has understood kal, he considers kal to be the main principle; if he has understood karma, he considers karma to be the main principle; and if he has understood maya, he considers maya to be the main principle. However, such a fool does not know how to distinguish between the different predominating factors prevalent in different circumstances. On the other hand, a person with gnan understands the predominance of various factors based on the circumstances.
21.13 "In fact, it is Bhagvan who is the inspirer of everything – of desh, kal, karma, and maya. It is He Himself who allows the factors of desh, kal, karma, and maya, to be predominant. Therefore, they are all dependent upon Bhagvan – just as the shishumar chakra is dependent on the support of the Dhruv star; and just as all the subjects of a kingdom are dependent on their king. Furthermore, in a kingdom, the minister and secretaries can only do as much as their king allows them to do; when the king does not allow it, they cannot do even the smallest of tasks. In the same way, the factors of desh, kal, karma, and maya can only do as much as Bhagvan allows them to do; they cannot do a single thing against the wish of Bhagvan. Therefore, only Bhagvan is the all-doer."
21.14 After delivering this talk, Shreeji Maharaj returned to the darbar.
21.15 Later that night, Shreeji Maharaj went to the residence of the sadhus. All the sadhus bowed down to Him and paid their respects. Shreeji Maharaj then said to the munis, "I have had a thought, which is why I have come to you at this hour. In my mind, I understand that whoever owns land and money, is the most unhappy; and whoever has very little money and no land, is the most happy.
21.16 "I have built a mandir in Amdavad Nagar, and others will also be built. However, a person should not unwilling donate money to for mandirs to be built. It is the wish of Shree Nar-Narayan if the mandir is built or not. However, we should do whatever does not cause problems for the mandir.
21.17 "Some festivals, like Janamashtmi, are celebrated using millions of rupees, due to the grace of Shree Nar-Narayan. Sometimes, festivals are celebrated using a tulsi leaf. The best way is whatever occurs without difficulty. However, a person should never ask for money for the mandir. Due to a person's shraddha in Shree Nar-Narayan, if they wish to donate their land, they should do so willingly. A person should not forcefully ask for anything."
21.18 Then, Shreeji Maharaj happily asked the sadhu a question, "Who do we call an ekantik bhakta?"
21.19 Muktanand Swami tried to answer the question, but was unable to give a satisfactory answer.
21.20 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A true ekantik bhakta sees himself as brahm-rup, who strictly follows his own dharma and performs bhakti, regularly performs dhyan and smaran of Bhagvan, and also keeps upasana of Bhagvan. He makes sure that there are no alterations in the vartmans followed by the body, which have been given by Bhagvan. A person with all these qualities should be regarded as an ekantik bhakta.
21.21 "Also, when there is a lack of bhakti on earth, bhakti remains within Nar-Narayan. Shree Nar-Narayan behaves just like the ekantik bhakta to teach the bhaktas who come to His feet. Ekantik bhaktas like this are only found in satsang. In other sects, there is upasana of Bhagvan, but there is no tyag and atma- gnan; in some sects there is atma- gnan, but no upasana and tyag; in some sects there is tyag, but no upasana and atma- gnan. However, at this time in our satsang, there are many bhaktas with all these qualities."
21.22 After deliviering this talk, Shreeji Maharaj returned to His residence.

Gadhada II – 22
Two Armies - The Installation Of Nar-Narayan Dev
22.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Fagan vad 10 [19th March 1822], Shreeji Maharaj awoke in the middle of the night and sat facing south on a decorated bedstead in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. He called all the sadhus and haribhaktas together, and so they gathered before Him in a sabha.
22.2 Addressing the sadhus, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I wish to talk, so please listen. When two armies are prepared for combat and both have implanted their flags opposite each other, in their minds both feel, 'We will capture their flag and shall raise our own in its place'. However, they never think, 'Along the way to the enemy's flag many heads will roll, and rivers of blood will flow'. In this way, they are never afraid. This is because those who are brave are not afraid of dying. However, a coward has thousands of thoughts of fleeing. He also thinks, 'If our army wins, we shall steal the wealth and weapons of our opponents'. In comparison, the brave soldiers of both kings are not afraid of dying, and nor do they have greedy motives to steal. Instead, they have only one desire – to capture the opponent's flag and ensure their own victory.
22.3 "Now, in this example, the flag represents the dham of Bhagvan, and the brave soldiers of the kings represent that loyal bhaktas of Bhagvan. Regardless of whether they encounter honours or insults in this world; regardless of whether they encounter bodily comforts or miseries; regardless of whether their bodies remain healthy or unhealthy; and regardless of whether their bodies survive or die, loyal bhaktas of Bhagvan never have weak thoughts such as, 'We will suffer this much pain', or 'We will enjoy this much happiness'. Neither of these two types of thoughts arise within their minds. Such bhaktas firmly believe, 'We want to attain the dham of Bhagvan within this very lifetime; we do not want to become tempt by anything along the way'.
22.4 "On the other hand, a bhakta of Bhagvan who identifies himself with the body is represented by the coward soldiers. While worshipping Bhagvan, he has thousands of weak thoughts such as, 'If the vartman become strict, I will not be able to survive; only if they are easy to follow will I be able to survive'. He also thinks, 'If I employ this method, I shall be happy even in worldly life. Also, if it is possible, I shall survive passively in satsang'. Such a bhakta represents the coward. However, a loyal and brave bhakta of Bhagvan never has any types of desires related to the body or the world."
22.5 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj then began to narrate an experience of His own. "When I went to Amdavad to install the murti of Shree Nar-Narayan Dev, thousands of people gathered for the festival. Following the completion of the installation of Shree Nar-Narayan Dev, and after thousands of brahmans from Amdavad had been fed, I departed from there and spent the night in Jetalpur. There, I began to think, 'I want to forget all memories of all of those people and all the activities I saw'. In doing this, I felt intense grief in my heart. As a result, I became ill. From there, I went to Dholka, where I spent the night. Then, walking from Dholka with the same thought in mind, I reached the forest of Ganesh Dholka near the village of Koth and spent the night there. I began to think so much that I forgot all about my body. While thinking, I forgot all the activities, and dispelled all those thoughts in such a way that it was as if I had not even stayed at Lake Kankaria, and as if there had been no festival; no thoughts remained at all.
22.6 "After those worldly thoughts had subsided, I began to look within. I began to see alokik powers and also the pleasures of the devs. I began to see countless types of heavenly vehicles, apsaras, clothes, and jewellery – just as if I were seeing them here in Mrutyu-Lok. However, in my heart I did not like anything except Bhagvan. Moreover, just as the panch-vishays here appear to be insignificant to me – with my mind never being tempted – in the same way, my mind was not tempted anywhere from Dev-Lok all the way to Brahm-Lok.
22.7 "Seeing this, all the devs began to praise me, 'You truly are an ekantik bhakta of Bhagvan; after all, your mind did not abandon Bhagvan and become tempted elsewhere'. On hearing their words, my heart gained a lot of courage. I then told my man, 'I know your true svarup. So, if you have a thought about any object other than Bhagvan, I will crush you to pieces'. In the same way, I told my buddhi, 'If you have any belief other than that of Bhagvan, then you will be in trouble'. Similarly, I told my chitt, 'If you think about anything other than Bhagvan, then I will also crush you to pieces'. In the same way, I told my ahankar, 'If you have any form of arrogance except that of servitude towards Bhagvan, I will destroy you'.
22.8 "Following this, just as I had totally forgotten all the objects of this lok, I also totally forgot all the objects of Dev-lok and Brahm-Lok. When all of those thoughts were dispelled, the illness that had arisen as a result of those thoughts also disappeared. Therefore, a person who is a bhakta of Bhagvan should behave in this way." Shreeji Maharaj narrated His own experiences for the sake of the kalyan of His bhaktas, while in reality; He Himself is the pratyaksha svarup of Shree Krishna Purushottam Narayan.
22.9 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "The Vasudev Mahatmya describes the dharma of an ekantik bhakta as follows: ' An ekantik bhakta does not believe his body to be his own true svarup; he believes himself to be composed of chaitanya. He performs bhakti of Bhagvan while observing svadharma, gnan, and vairagya. Also, he maintains no desire for any object other than Bhagvan'. When he becomes such a sadhu by worshipping Bhagvan in this way, there is no greater status. For example, in a kingdom, the queen's authority is equal to that of the king. In the same way, that sadhu possesses as much majesty as Bhagvan. Therefore, a sadhu should not wish for the insignificant pleasures of worldly life. This is because when that sadhu attains the dham of Bhagvan, then just as the lords of countless millions of brahmands bring countless types of gifts for Bhagvan, they also bring them for that sadhu. Moreover, by the grace of Bhagvan, that sadhu acquires alokik powers and strength. Keeping such a great thought in the mind, a person should not desire anything other than Bhagvan. For example, a person who has obtained a chintamani should look after it with great care. This is because it will enable him to obtain any object he desires. Similarly, a bhakta of Bhagvan should hold on to the chintamani in the form of Bhagvan's murti; he should never abandon it. Only then will he attain everything."

Gadhada II – 23
Heat And Frost
23.1 In the Samvat year 1878, on Jyeshth sud 11 [31st May 1822], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had also covered Himself with a white chadar. He had tied a white pagh around His head. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
23.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Today, I thought about the nature of the mind. It appears that the mind is not separate from the jeev; it is a reflection of the jeev itself, but not separate from it. I also observed that the nature of the mind is like the heat of summer and the frost of winter. Just as a person can die from heat or frost, in the same way, when the mind travels towards the vishays via the indriyas, if those vishays are full of miseries, the mind becomes 'hot' like the heat of summer; and if those vishays are full of happiness, then the mind becomes 'cold' like the frost of winter. Specifically, when the mind – having indulged in those vishays which are full of misery and having become 'hot' like the scorching winds of summer heat – enters a person's heart, it makes the person extremely miserable and forces him to fall from the path of kalyan. Such a person should be known to have died from the effects of heat. When the mind – having indulged in the pleasures of those vishays that are full of happiness and having become 'cold' like frost – enters a person's heart, it makes that person satisfied, and causes him to fall from the path of kalyan. He should be known to have died due to frost.
23.3 "However, a person whose mind remains unmoved – it does not become 'hot' upon experiencing repulsive vishays and does not become 'cold' upon experiencing pleasurable vishays – should be known as a param-bhagvat sant. However, it is no small achievement to develop the mind in this way.
23.4 "Moreover, the mind is like a child. If a child attempts to grasp a snake, or touch a flame, or perhaps hold an unsheathed sword, it becomes upset when it is not allowed to do so; and even if it is allowed to do so, it will be hurt and upset. Similarly, if the mind is not allowed to indulge in them, it turns away from Bhagvan, and becomes extremely miserable. Therefore, only a person whose mind has a craving for Bhagvan and which becomes neither 'hot' nor 'cold' by the vishays, should be known as a sadhu."

Gadhada II – 24
Firmness In Sankhya And In Yog
24.1 In the Samvat year 1879, on Shravan sud 8 [26th July 1822], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj arrived at Lakshmi-Vadi on horseback from Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. There, He sat on a platform facing north. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. He was wearing a garland of mogra flowers around His neck, and a tassel of mogra flowers was also inserted in His pagh. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
24.2 Then, Muktanand Swami asked Shreeji Maharaj, "Maharaj, does a bhakta who has firm belief in Bhagvan experience any obstacles, or not?"
24.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A bhakta may be firm in two ways: One is by being firm in yog, and the other is by being firm in sankhya. Of these, a bhakta who is firm in yog keeps his vrutti constantly fixed on the svarup of Bhagvan. A bhakta who is firm in sankhya understands the extent of human pleasures, as well as the extent of the pleasures of the great yogis, charans, vidyadhars, gandharvas, and devs. In addition, he considers the pleasures of the fourteen loks and believes, 'These pleasures are only so much'. He also considers the miseries that follow those pleasures. As a result, he develops vairagya towards those misery-filled pleasures, and maintains profound love only for Bhagvan. So, a person who is firm in sankhya possesses the strength of understanding.
24.4 "In comparison, the strength of a person who is firm in yog is based only on keeping his vrutti constantly on the svarup of Bhagvan. If he were to encounter some disturbances due to unpleasant circumstances, then although his vrutti was originally fixed on Bhagvan's svarup, it would become attached elsewhere as well. This is because a person who is firm in yog somewhere lacks the strength of understanding. Therefore, it is possible that such a bhakta may experience obstacles.
24.5 "However, if a person is firm in both sankhya and yog, then there would be no problem whatsoever. Such a bhakta of Bhagvan is never tempted by any other object than the murti of Bhagvan. He realises, 'With the exception of Bhagvan's Akshardham, and Bhagvan's murti and the bhaktas within Akshardham, everything else – all the loks, the devs, and the wealth of the devs – is perishable'. Realising this, he maintains profound love only for Bhagvan. Such a bhakta never experiences any sort of obstacles whatsoever."

A Tyagi With Worldly Desires, And A Grahastha With No Desires 
25.1 In the Samvat year 1879, on Shravan vad 6 [8th August 1822], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the south-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
25.2 Addressing all the paramhans, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please listen, as I wish to ask you a question. First, suppose there is a tyagi bhakta of Bhagvan who is strict in following the physical vartman. However, within his heart, he has an intense desire to indulge in the vishays. Nevertheless, he does not physically give in to those desires. Such is the tyagi. There is another bhakta who is a grahastha. Physically, he has close contact with both women and wealth. However, in his heart, he is free of all worldly desires. So, the question is what will be their fate after death? Will they both attain the same state? Or will one become superior to the other? Please consider the differences between the two and give an answer for each separately.
25.3 Then, Gopalanand Swami replied, "When the tyagi passes away, because of the intense desires in his heart to indulge in the vishays, Bhagvan will make him a wealthy grahastha either in this Mrutyu-Lok or in Dev-Lok, where he will attain a great amount of vishays to indulge in. In fact, in Dev-Lok, he will indulge in vishays like those of a person who had strayed from his spiritual activities as described in the Bhagvad Geeta.
25.4 "On the other hand, when the grahastha bhakta passes away, because he is free of worldly desires, he will attain the dham of Bhagvan – Brahmpur – where he will reside at the holy feet of Bhagvan.
25.5 "As far as the tyagi is concerned, when he becomes satisfied after indulging in the vishays, he will eventually develop vairagya towards them; and then, feeling guilty in his mind, he will engage in the worship of Bhagvan. Then, he will become free of worldly desires and attain the dham of Bhagvan."
25.6 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj commented, "Correct. That is the exact answer to the question."
25.7 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "If a person has such strong worldly desires and wishes to eradicate them, by which method can they be eradicated?"
25.8 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Just as Uka Khachar has become addicted to serving the sadhus, in the same way, if a person becomes addicted to serving Bhagvan and His sant to the extent that he would not be able to stay for even a moment without serving them, then all the impure desires in his antah- karans will be destroyed."
25.9 Then, Svayamprakashanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, by which means is Bhagvan extremely pleased?"
25.10 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a bhakta who once had only twenty kilograms of grains in his house were to attain the control of a village, or the control of five villages, or the control of fifty villages, or the control of one hundred villages, or even the control of the entire world; and after this, if he remains just as loving and humble with a sant as he was when he was poor and modest, and if he remains just as humble even if he were to attain the kingdom of Indra-Lok and Brahm-Lok, then Bhagvan would be extremely pleased upon him.
25.11 "As for a tyagi, even after attaining powers similar to those possessed by Bhagvan, if he can continue to serve all sadhus in exactly the same way as he did when he was new and timid, and not attempt to impose his authority upon other sadhus or try to compete with them, then Bhagvan would be extremely pleased with him."

Obstactles Of Bhakti
26.1 That Which Displeases Bhagvan Should Not Be Done 26.1 In the Samvat year 1879, on the night of Bhadarva sud 11 [29th August 1822], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
26.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A bhakta of Bhagvan should never do anything that displeases Bhagvan and His bhaktas, and he should also abandon all those who obstruct him in worshipping Bhagvan, even if they are his own relatives. Also, just as a person abandons an enemy, he should abandon any svabhav that does not please Bhagvan. Furthermore, he should never support those who are vimukhs, just as Bharatji did not support his own mother. Also, a bhakta of Bhagvan should mainly perceive avgun in himself. On the other hand, a person who perceives avgun in others and only gun in himself, may be known as a satsang i, but he should be known to be half-fallen.
26.3 "Furthermore, for a bhakta of Bhagvan, if gnan of the atma, vairagya, or dharma are an obstacle in his bhakti towards Bhagvan, then he should suppress even them and maintain the predominance of bhakti only. However, if they are supportive in offering bhakti, then they are fine. Only a person who has this understanding can be called a complete bhakta of Bhagvan.
26.4 "Also, no matter how great he may be, if a person perceives avgun in others and gun in himself, he will certainly encounter obstacles on the path of kalyan. For example, Radhikaji was great and she also had intense love for Bhagvan. However, when she perceived gun in herself and avgun in Shree Krishna Bhagvan, a trace of tamo-gun entered into her love for Him. Then, she quarrelled with Shree Krishna Bhagvan and Shreedama. As a result of this, Shreedama cursed her. Radhikaji then fell from Golok, and took birth in the home of a carpenter. She had to marry a man other than Bhagvan, and suffered a severe disgrace. Even Shreedama perceived gun in himself, and perceived avgun in Radhikaji. For that reason, he was cursed by Radhikaji and had to become a demon.
26.5 "However, this is not the way of falling from the dham of Bhagvan; for those who have fallen have done so due to Bhagvan's will. After all, Bhagvan has declared, 'Even a person who is as great as Radhikaji will fall if he perceives gun in himself and perceives avgun in bhaktas of Bhagvan. If that is so, what can be said of others?' Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvan should see only gun in all satsangis and should find only avgun in himself. If a person has such an understanding, then even if he is not very intelligent, his satsang still becomes stronger day by day. Without it, even if he is very intelligent, he will fall back from satsang; and in the end will certainly become a vimukh.
26.6 "Also, the following practice is observed everywhere: When a king or a guru lectures and disciplines a servant or a shishya, if the servant or shishya accepts it positively, then the king or the guru has tremendous affection for him. However, they do not feel affection towards a person who reacts negatively when given such advice. Bhagvan's method is similar. When He gives advice to someone, if they accept it positively, He develops affection for them; and if they react negatively, He does not develop affection for them."

Gadhada II – 27
Mandirs Built For Bhakti And Upasana
27.1 In the Samvat year 1879, on Kartik sud 11 [25th November 1822], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the south-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A garland of white and yellow guldavadi flowers adorned His neck, and tassels hung from both sides of His pagh. A sabha of paramhans as well as haribhaktas from various places had gathered before Him.
27.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked Muktanand Swami, "What causes krodh to arise within you? Also, how much of that cause does it take for you to become angry? As for me, even if someone spends anything from one to one hundred thousand rupees, I would not become angry for my own sake. However, if someone disobeys his own dharma, or if an arrogant person abuses a humble person, or if someone sides with injustice, then for the sake of another person, I do become angry for a brief moment; but never do I become angry for my own sake. Even when I do express krodh for the sake of another person, it does not last for even a second, nor is any grudge formed. So, my question to you is what causes krodh to arise within you and how is it eradicated?"
27.3 Muktanand Swami relied, "Krodh arises due to association with some objects or on seeing evil in a person; but it subsides instantly."
27.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "By what thought process do you manage to do that?"
27.5 Muktanand Swami replied, "First, by thinking of Bhagvan's greatness, I realise, 'I do not wish to retain any svabhavs that would displease Bhagvan'. Secondly, after examining the path of sadhus like Shukji and Jadbharat, I think, 'Such an inappropriate svabhav does not suit a sadhu'."
27.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj commented, "Such a thought that is capable of repelling the force of kam and krodh, is beyond the gun of Maya, and it is firm in your jeev. In fact, such thoughts that repel the influence of kam and krodh are due to the sanskars of past lives. Also, regarding your nature, I know this much: Initially, you may become attached to worldly objects that you come across, but in the end, you do not remain attached to them; you are capable of breaking that bondage."
27.7 Then, Muktanand Swami questioned, "Why does the deficiency of becoming influenced in the first place still remain?"
27.8 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Each of the eight factors of desh, kal, kriya, sang, dhyan, mantra, diksha, and shastra, has a force equal to that of the past sanskars. Therefore, when a person encounters them, they overpower the force of the past sanskars. After all, if good deeds and bad deeds are performed only by the influence of a person's sanskars, then all the distinctions of vidhi and nishedh – 'This should be done and this should not be done' – as prescribed in the Veds, the six-shastras, and the Purans, would become meaningless. But, these shastras, which have been written by the great, can never become false.
27.9 "Just see, Jay and Vijay behaved improperly, and as a result they fell from the dham of Bhagvan, where there is no influence of Kal, karma, or Maya. On the other hand, Prahlad pleased Naradji and therefore, even though circumstances were unpleasant, they were unable to obstruct him. However, even though circumstances were pleasant in Jay and Vijay's case, because the Sanakadik were angered, Jay and Vijay fell from the dham of Bhagvan. Therefore, a person who wishes to attain kalyan should do whatever pleases the great sant. Such a sant becomes pleased when there are no traces of impure desires left within a person's heart.
27.10 "A person should keep in mind, that a person who has krodh and other vicious natures towards a humble person, will develop such feelings towards the great, and then also towards his ishta-dev. Therefore, a person wishing to attain kalyan should not have any vicious feelings towards anyone; and if he does, then he is sure to develop hatred towards bhaktas of Bhagvan, and then eventually towards Bhagvan as well.
27.11 "That is why if I have upset even one humble person, I think, 'Bhagvan resides as antaryami in all. While staying in one place, He knows what is in everyone's heart. So, since He must also be present in the heart of the person whom I have upset, I have offended Bhagvan as well'. Realising this, I bow down to him, give him whatever he wishes, and do whatever is necessary to please him."
27.12 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj continued, "I have thought and realised that if a person maintains too much tyag or too much compassion, then he cannot offer bhakti towards Bhagvan, and therefore causing him to betray his upasana. For example, from the past, we notice that upasana eventually perished in those who were extreme tyagis. Therefore, having thought about this, and for the sake of preserving upasana, I have relaxed the emphasis on tyag and have built mandirs of Bhagvan. So, even if only a little tyag remains, upasana will at least be preserved, and through it, many jeevs will attain kalyan.
27.13 "On the other hand, how is it possible for a person who wishes to offer bhakti to Bhagvan to retain compassion like that of Jain sadhus? After all, a bhakta is required to pick flowers and tulsi for Bhagvan; he is required to bring various types of vegetables, and to grow gardens for Bhagvan; he must also build mandirs. Therefore, a person who sits idly, maintaining extreme tyag and compassion, is unable to offer bhakti to Bhagvan. When bhakti diminishes, the upasana of Bhagvan is also destroyed, and a lineage of blind followers results. That is why I have had mandirs built – for the purpose of preserving Bhagvan's upasana forever.
27.14 "Moreover, a bhakta with upasana never deviates from his dharma. Therefore, my principle is to perform the bhakti and upasana of Bhagvan while maintaining dharma."

Serving A Bhakta Pleases Bhagvan
28.1 In the Samvat year 1879, on Fagan sud 2 [13th February, 1823], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting facing west on a square platform at His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a white p a gh around His head. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
28.2 Then, Pragji Davé said, "There is no shastra like the Shreemad Bhagvat."
28.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Yes, the Shreemad Bhagvat is certainly good, but there is no shastra like the Vasudev Mahatmya, which is a part of the Skand Puran. After all, in that shastra, great emphasis has been placed on dharma, bhakti, gnan, and vairagya, as well as ahinsa."
28.4 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj continued, "The Valmiki Ramayan and Harivansh have placed great emphasis on hinsa. In fact, even Ramchandraji behaved according to the characteristics of a kshatriya. Even though Ramchandraji protected anyone who sought refuge at His feet, He would immediately abandon them if they committed even the slightest mistake. For example, even though Sitaji became subject to only minor public criticism, He instantly abandoned her, even though she was very dear to him."
28.5 Hearing this, Muktanand Swami commented, "Ramanand Swami's nature was similar."
28.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj revealed, "My nature is not like that. I have great compassion for bhaktas of Bhagvan. Of the Pandavs, Arjun was also of a very compassionate nature. Amongst all men, there has been no man like Ramchandraji and Arjun, and amongst all women there has been no woman like Sitaji and Draupadi.
28.7 "Now, I shall describe my own nature. Even though I have a compassionate nature, if a person spites bhaktas of Bhagvan, then I have a dislike towards that person. If I hear someone speaking unpleasantly of bhaktas, then I would not feel like speaking to them, even if I had to. On the other hand, I become extremely pleased with someone who serves the bhaktas of Bhagvan. In fact, my nature is such that I do not become easily pleased or displeased over small matters, but only after observation over several days of whether a person is worthy of my pleasure or displeasure, do I become pleased or displeased. I never become pleased or displeased with a person by simply hearing someone's opinions of that person; I only appreciate those qualities that I perceive with my own mind. Also, my preference is as follows: 'If a person is a genuine bhakta of Bhagvan, then I am a bhakta of that bhakta, and I do the bhakti of such bhaktas of Bhagvan'. This is my greatest quality. A person who does not have that quality is not worthy of any type of greatness.
28.8 "Conversely, those who have perceived avgun in bhaktas of Bhagvan, even though they were very great, have fallen from their status of importance. Those who progress do so only by serving bhaktas of Bhagvan, and those who regress do so only by spiting bhaktas of Bhagvan. In fact, the only method for a person to please Bhagvan is to serve bhaktas by thought, word, and deed. The only method to displease Bhagvan is to spite bhaktas.
28.9 "Therefore, my principle is that if Bhagvan is pleased with me, and I have the company of the bhaktas of Bhagvan, then even if I were to stay far away from Bhagvan for countless years, I would not feel any grief mentally. On the other hand, if Bhagvan is not pleased with me, then even if I were to stay near Bhagvan, I would not consider that to be good. Moreover, the essence of all the shastras is 'A person should only do that which pleases Bhagvan'. In fact, a person who does not do that which pleases Bhagvan should be known to have fallen from the path of Bhagvan.
28.10 "If a person has the company of the bhaktas of Bhagvan and also has earned Bhagvan's pleasure, then even though he is in Mrutyu-Lok, he is still in the dham of Bhagvan. This is because a person who serves a sant and earns Bhagvan's favour will certainly stay near Bhagvan. Conversely, even if a bhakta is in the dham of Bhagvan, if he has not earned Bhagvan's favour and is jealous of bhaktas of Bhagvan, then that bhakta will certainly fall from that dham.
28.11 "For this reason, in order to please Bhagvan, I desire only to serve bhaktas of Bhagvan in this life and all subsequent lives. Furthermore, just as this is my belief, all of you should also make the same belief."
28.12 Then, Muktanand Swami and all the other bhaktas folded their hands in prayer and said, "Maharaj, we also wish to keep such a belief." Having said this, all the bhaktas pledged and bowed at Shreeji Maharaj's feet.
28.13 Finally, Shreeji Maharaj added, "I have delivered this talk to you after hearing and extracting the essence from the Veds, the six- shastras, the Purans and all other words on this earth relating to moksh. This is the most profound and fundamental principle, and it is the essence of all essences. For all those who have previously attained moksh, for all those who will attain it in the future, and for all those who are presently treading the path of moksh, this talk is like a lifeline."

The Characteristics Of A Person Who Is Attached To Bhagvan
29.1 In the Samvat year 1879, on Fagan sud 8 [18th February 1823], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places had gathered before Him.
29.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A bhakta whose mind has become deeply attached to the svarup of Shree Krishna Bhagvan has the following characteristics: Firstly, even though they may be extremely exhausted after prolonged walking and do not have enough strength left in their body even to sit upright, if an opportunity to talk about Bhagvan arises, then he becomes attentive and most willing to narrate and hear such talks – as if he has not walked even a single mile. Also, regardless of any disease or illness that may be a source of pain for them, and regardless of being insulted, if they hear talks about Bhagvan, then they would instantly be relieved of all their miseries. Furthermore, they may appear to be totally engrossed in the wealth and property they have attained, but the moment they hear talks of Bhagvan, it would seem as if they have no association with anything else. This would be their eagerness to listen to talks about Bhagvan. A person who has these characteristics should be known to have developed deep attachment to Bhagvan."
29.3 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "How does such deep attachment towards Bhagvan develop?"
29.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Either due to very strong sanskars from past lives, or by serving and therefore pleasing the sant of Bhagvan who has such firm attachment with Bhagvan – these two methods help create deep attachment towards Bhagvan. Besides these, there are no other methods."

Gadhada II – 30
Women And Gold
30.1 In the Samvat year 1879, on sud 9 of the second Chaitra [19th April 1823], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow on the veranda outside the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had tied a black-bordered cloth around His head, and a tassel of flowers was hanging from His pagh. He was also wearing a garland of flowers around His neck. A sabha of sadhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
30.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The Shreemad Bhagvat and the other sacred shastras are satya; so reality reflects what is stated in those shastras. Just see, in the Shreemad Bhagvat, it is said that Kali ( Kali-Yug) resides in gold; and for that reason, I do not like even the sight of gold. Also, like gold, beauty is a source of attachment. After all, when a beautiful woman enters a sabha, even the most composed person cannot remain without being drawn towards her beauty. Therefore, gold and women are the source of extreme attachment.
30.3 "A person does not become attached to gold and women when he realises the pure chaitanya brahm as the only satya; when he realises that brahm to be his own self; when he becomes brahm- rup and worships Shree Krishna Bhagvan, who is Parbrahm; when he realises Prakruti and all the entities which have evolved from it – all of which are below Brahm – as being asatya, perishable, and worthless; and when he views all mayik names and forms as flawed and develops intense vairagya towards all those names and forms. Only under these conditions do gold and women not bind a person; otherwise, they most certainly will cause a person to become bound by them."

Gadhada II – 31
Jeev, Ishvar, Maya, Brahm, Parbrahm
31.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Shravan sud 4 [10th August 1823], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a square platform at His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. He had also tied a black-bordered cloth around His head. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places had gathered before Him. At that time, the Kapil Geeta (a section of the Shreemad Bhagvat) was being read by the Pragji Davé.
31.2 Following the reading, Shreeji Maharaj said to the paramhans, "Vasudev Bhagvan – who is Purushottam, the cause of all causes, and who is greater than Akshar – implants masculine power in Maha-Maya through Maha-Purush. That Purush is like Akshar, he is a mukta, and he is also known as Brahm. When that Purush implants his masculine power in Maya, Virat-Purush is said to be the son of its respective Purush. Just as a brahman, a kshatriya, a vaishya, or another man of this world produces a son with his wife, similarly, Virat- Purush is also produced.
31.3 "That Virat- Purush is just like this jeev, and his actions are also similar to the jeev. The lifespan of that Virat-Purush is two parardhs. The creation, sustenance, and destruction of this universe are his three states, just as jagrat, svapna, and sushupti are the three states of the jeev. Virat, sutratma, and avyakrut are the three bodies of that Virat-Purush. These bodies, which are encircled by the eight barriers ( jad prakruti), have been produced from the twenty-four tattvas.
31.4 "The indriyas, antah-karans, and their presiding devs entered that Virat and attempted to awaken him. Despite Virat's jeev being inside his body, Virat still did not awaken. Only when Vasudev Bhagvan – the kshetragna – entered within him in the svarup of Purush did the body of Virat awaken. Only then did Virat-Purush become capable of performing all his activities.
31.5 "To inspire the jeev, that same Bhagvan – while remaining beyond Maya in the form of sushupti – resides in the jeev as its witness. However, the jeev has been associated with the body, the indriyas, and the vishays. As a result of this improper association, the jeev has become one with the body, and the indriyas. After abandoning their association, the jeev realises, 'My self is brahm, which is transcendental and free from maya.' If a person associates with brahm through continuous thinking in this way, the jeev acquires the qualities of that brahm. However, it is a great fault of the jeev that even after hearing this fact, it cannot maintain constant remembrance that it is brahm.
31.6 "In this way, the inspirer of both the ishvar ( Virat-Purush) and of this jeev is Purushottam – also known as Vasudev – in the svarup of Purush. Like the jeev, that Virat-Purush is also bound by maya; and remains bound until he completes his lifespan of two parardhs. When he dies, he gets direct contact with that Purush. This is because his father ( Purush) is powerful and cares for him appropriately. So, because Virat-Purush is attached to Maya, he is again produced from Maya at the end of destruction.
31.7 "Moreover, just as the jeev is bound and powerless, in the same way its father is also bound and powerless. Then, how can the father help the son? Therefore, the jeev remains continuously attached to maya in the form of sushupti. However, that attachment is never broken. It is only broken when a person constantly associates with his inspirer ( brahm), through thinking – as previously described.
31.8 "Also, Virat-Purush worships Sankarshan, Aniruddha, and Pradyumna. Specifically, during the state of destruction, he worships Sankarshan; during the state of sustenance, he worships Pradyumna; and during the state of creation, he worships Aniruddha. In fact, Sankarshan, Aniruddha, and Pradyumna are the sagun svarups of Vasudev Bhagvan, and it is the strength of the upasana of Virat-Purush that he becomes capable of performing the activities of creation, sustenance, and destruction. Moreover, as long as he worships these three, his association with Maya – in the form of creation, sustenance, and destruction – is not broken. It is when he worships Vasudev Bhagvan, who is nirgun, that Virat-Purush abandons Maya and becomes brahm-rup. Similarly, when the jeev worships Bhagvan in the svarup of Brahma and other devs, it attains rewards in the form of dharma, arth, and kam. However, when it worships the avatars of Bhagvan, it becomes brahm-rup and attains kalyan. The same applies for Virat-Purush.
31.9 "Now, it is said in the shastras that the avatars are formed from that Virat-Purush. This should be understood as follows: When Vasudev- Narayan – through the svarup of Purush – comes and resides in Virat- Purush, He is said to be an avatar. Therefore, all those avatars are Vasudev Bhagvan's only. When the Vasudev Bhagvan withdraws Himself and separates from Virat-Purush, then it is not possible for an avatar to be formed through Virat-Purush alone. Therefore, the descriptions of avatars manifesting through him are only because of the presence of Vasudev in him. In fact, when Vasudev – the kshetragna – had not yet entered him, that Virat-Purush was not even capable of performing any of his own activities.
31.10 "When Purush impregnates Maya, a son in the form of Virat-Purush is produced via Pradhan- Purush. From that same Maya, many brahmands – in the form of many Virat-Purush – are produced via countless Pradhan- Purush pairs. Furthermore, that Purush has no desires, he is a mukta, he is brahm-rup, and he is the cause of Maya. Although he stays within Maya, he still remains unaffected by Maya. Also, he has no desire to enjoy Maya since he is happy due to the bliss of brahm; therefore, he is fulfilled.
31.11 "The ishvar known as Virat-Purush indulges in the pleasures of maya and then, at the time of destruction, abandons Maya. On the other hand, the jeev indulges in the pleasures of maya and then merges into Maya, remaining miserable."
31.12 Shuk Muni then asked, "Purushottam Vasudev, in the svarup of Purush, is the cause of the creation, sustenance, and destruction of countless brahmands. Consequently, the shastras generally describe Purushottam as Purush. But, what is the extent of the distinction between Purush and Vasudev?"
31.13 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "Just as there is a difference between the jeev and Virat-Purush, who is an ishvar; and just as there is also a difference between ishvar and Purush, similarly, there is an immense difference between Purush and Vasudev Bhagvan. Purushottam Vasudev Bhagvan is the master of all, whereas there are many such brahm-rup Purush who worship the holy feet of Vasudev and who offer to praise to Him. In this way, Purushottam, Purush, ishvar, jeev, and Maya are the five eternal entities.
31.14 "I have explained this fact in this way many times, but it is not firmly fixed in a person's heart due to a lack of deep thinking. As a result, after listening to the words of the shastras, no stability remains in a person's understanding. However, if it has been absolutely fixed, then his understanding would never falter on listening to such words. Therefore, this fact should be thoroughly thought of and written down."
31.15 In this way, the talk delivered by Shreeji Maharaj has been written.

Gadhada II – 32
Detaching From The Body
32.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Shravan sud 5 [11th August 1823], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. He had tied a black-bordered cloth around His head, and garlands of flowers were hanging around His neck. Also, bunches of flowers had been placed above His ears, and tassels of flowers were placed upon His head. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
32.2 Then, addressing all of haribhaktas, Shreeji Maharaj said, "In worldly life, the love a person has for family members is like that of a cactus plant or the branch of a banyan or pipal tree – if they are cut and planted elsewhere, they would once again grow into trees. In comparison, once a mango tree or a neem tree is cut, it does not take root again. The love that a person has for those other than his family members is like that of the mango tree or the neem tree; whereas the love a person has for his family members is like the cactus plant and banyan tree – if they have been cut down, they definitely do grow again, even while lying in the soil.
32.3 "For this reason, the love that a person has for his family is only uprooted when he realises his true svarup to be the jeevatma, distinct from the three bodies of sthul, sukshma and karan; when, after discarding all pride of gender, varna and ashram, he beholds Bhagvan's murti within it; and when he becomes eager to engage only in the worship of Bhagvan. Only then will the love for his family be completely cut. Besides this, there is no other means to do so."
32.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj continued, "The sole cause behind the jeev attaining kalyan, overcoming maya, and becoming brahm-svarup is its engagement in the gnan, dhyan, kirtans, and katha of the pratyaksha svarup of Vasudev Bhagvan, who is Purushottam. It is due to these that the jeev overcomes maya, attains an extremely elevated state, and also attains Bhagvan's Akshardham. In this, atma- nishtha, vairagya, and dharma are merely helpful in offering bhakti to Bhagvan. Without the bhakti of Bhagvan, vairagya, atma- nishtha, and dharma alone are not capable of allowing the jeev to overcome maya. In fact, even if a person does not possess intense dharma, atma- nishtha, or vairagya, if he possesses only bhakti towards Bhagvan, then he would still attain kalyan. This is the power of bhakti over dharma, atma- nishtha, and vairagya.
32.5 "However, only with the help of dharma, atma- nishtha, and vairagya, is unobstructed bhakti possible. Without those other characteristics, there will definitely be difficulties in offering bhakti during times of unpleasant circumstances. That is why a person should offer bhakti coupled with dharma, atma- nishtha, and vairagya.
32.6 "Having said this, even if a bhakta who offers such bhakti happens to be confronted by unpleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang, then although he is a bhakta of Bhagvan, his heart would indeed become disturbed, and he would become unpredictable. Therefore, a person should abandon unpleasant desh, unpleasant kal, unpleasant kriya, and unpleasant sang and forever associate with pleasant desh, pleasant kal, pleasant kriya, and pleasant sang; but never should a person associate with unpleasant circumstances."

The Vow Of Nishkam
33.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Shravan vad 13 [18th September 1823], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
33.2 Then, addressing all the sadhus and bhaktas, Shreeji Maharaj said, "First, I shall talk about my strengths. After that, all of you can describe your personal thoughts on how you feel kalyan can be attained, and you can also explain how you think you should behave in order for Bhagvan to be pleased with you in this lok and other loks."
33.3 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj began to describe His own strength, saying, "If it appears to me that I have a liking for something, I would only be happy after I have discarded it. Should I recall in my mind any object or any person other than bhaktas of Bhagvan, then I would feel comfortable only after I have totally distanced myself from that object or person. Also, in my heart, in no way do I ever experience a dislike towards a bhakta of Bhagvan. Even though I am forcefully offered the panch-vishays without actually wishing for them myself, I still do not have any desire for them; I push them away. In fact, I take oath on the lives of these paramhans that from the day I was born to this very day, I have never had an improper thought regarding women or wealth, either in the jagrat state or in the svapna state. Therefore, I am eternally flawless. A person who perceives any avgun in me will himself suffer from vicious thoughts both in the jagrat and svapna state. Moreover, he will suffer greatly at the time of his death as well.
33.4 "In addition, only the thought of Bhagvan remains within my heart, and although I outwardly meet and associate with bhaktas of Bhagvan, it is solely for the benefit of their jeevs. Indeed, the day when I feel that I have developed love for something other than the bhaktas of Bhagvan, I will consider myself as having been displaced from my spiritual status. However, I am confident that that would never happen. Therefore, I have described my strength to you. Now, all of you can describe your own personal strengths."
33.5 Hearing this, all the sadhus and bhaktas each described their strengths, which were their beliefs as to how Bhagvan would be pleased upon them if they were to abide by that strength in this lok and other loks. Of them, some described how they possess vairagya of everything except Bhagvan; others mentioned their quality of atma-nishtha; some spoke of their love for Bhagvan; and some mentioned their observance of dharma. In this way, many different strengths were mentioned. However, no one mentioned the strength that Shreeji Maharaj had in mind.
33.6 So, Shreeji Maharaj said, "If a person firmly observes the vow of nishkam, then he is never far from Bhagvan – whether he is in this lok or other loks. Moreover, my love for such a person never diminishes. In fact, the very reason that I have stayed here is because of the determination of the bhaktas to observe the vow of nishkam. If a person strictly observes that vow, then even if I were a thousand miles away from him, I would still be close to him. Conversely, if a person is slack in his observance of the vow of nishkam, then even if he is beside me, he is as good as a hundred thousand miles away. Also, I only like the service offered by a bhakta who is nishkami. It is only because this Mulji Brahm-Chari is extremely strict in his observance of the vow of nishkam that I like his seva very much. However, if someone else does seva, I am not as pleased.
33.7 "Furthermore, in all the talks that I deliver, I always strongly promote the observance of the vow of nishkam. I have been firmly reinforcing this since the day I was born.
33.8 "When a sabha has gathered, if a man or woman looks at someone else with kam, then no matter how hard they may try to conceal it, it never escapes my attention. At that time, I become extremely displeased upon that person, and even my face turns red. It hurts me deeply, but feeling obliged, I cannot say much. Furthermore, being a sadhu, I keep my feelings within my heart. However, if I were to adopt the ways of a king, I would punish that person severely.
33.9 "That is why I have already instructed all the senior paramhans and senior women that if any male or female bhakta in satsang commits a breach in his or her observance of the vow of nishkam, then please do not inform me of it. This is because I am deeply saddened when I hear such things – just as a childless couple would feel saddened if their newly born son were to suddenly die. In fact, at such times, I feel like abandoning this satsang and leaving. Therefore, only those who observe this vow of nishkam are dear to me; they and I will always be very close, both in his lok and other loks."
33.10 Then, Harji Thakkar asked, "By what means can a person's observance of the vow of nishkam become extremely firm?"
33.11 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "There is a way, and it comprises of three components. Just as many components make up a bull-cart – the driver, the pair of bulls, the wheels, the yoke, the supporting assembly, and the wooden frame – similarly, many components are required to be able to firmly observe the vow of nishkam. Of these, there are three that are absolutely fundamental.
33.12 "The first is to conquer the mind by constantly thinking, 'I am the atma, not the body'. Also, the mind should be continuously kept engaged in the nine types of bhakti. It should not be left unoccupied for even a moment. For example, if a man conquers a ghost, but does not assign it some work to do, the ghost would turn onto the man himself. In this sense, the mind is just like a ghost; when it is not engaged in the bhakti of Bhagvan, it begins to think of evil thoughts. This can be compared to the ghost getting ready to devour the man. For this reason, the mind should continuously be kept occupied in kathas and kirtans related to Bhagvan. This can be known as having conquered the mind.
33.13 "The second component is to keep the prans under control. Shree Krishna Bhagvan has said in the Bhagvad Geeta, 'A person's diet and activity should be kept regulated; he should not keep a strong yearning for food'. A person who behaves in this way is said to have kept his prans under control. If this is not done, he will feel an intense yearning for food in his mind. Consequently, his tongue will crave after the countless types of tastes. As a result, any other indriyas that he may have conquered will also become free. Therefore, a person should control his prans by controlling his diet.
33.14 "The third component requires a person to control his body by physically keeping it within the niyams prescribed in satsang for each individual.
33.15 "So, by strictly observing these three components in this way, a person's observance of the vow of nishkam becomes extremely firm. However, a person should not consider this to be very difficult to practice; it is not at all difficult for someone who is, after all, a sadhu. The enemies, such as kam, krodh, and lobh prevail strongly even in a sadhu, but to please Bhagvan, he would still abandon them; only then can he be called a true sadhu.
33.16 "After all, what is impossible to achieve with this human body? That which is practiced regularly can definitely be achieved. For example, due to the daily drawing of water from a well, the constant rubbing of even a soft rope can cause a groove in the very hard piece of rock that lies on the edge of that well. Similarly, for a person who is a sadhu and who continuously persists in his efforts for eradicating his svabhavs, how long can those svabhavs remain? They most certainly will be destroyed. Therefore, a person who wishes to observe the vow of nishkam should intensely employ the method that comprises of the three components I have just described."

Gadhada II – 34
Are The Tattvas Jad Or Chaitanya?
34.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Bhadarva sud 1 [5th September 1823], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white dhoti and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a black-bordered cloth around His head. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the paramhans were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a dukad and saroda.
34.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Please stop the kirtans, and let us conduct a question-answer discussion in order to dispel drowsiness."
34.3 Having said that, Shreeji Maharaj continued, "First of all, allow me to ask a question: The twenty-four tattvas, such as the indriyas and antah-karans which are the result of Maya, reside in the jeev. Now, are those elements jad, or are they chaitanya?"
34.4 The paramhans replied, "Those tattvas are definitely chaitanya. "
34.5 Hearing the reply, Shreeji Maharaj contradicted, "If those elements are chaitanya, then along with the jeev residing in this body, there should be twenty-four jeevs for the twenty-four tattvas. Therefore, when the jeev attains kalyan, it would be distributed among all of them. Moreover, all sins that are committed by the jeev would also be distributed among all of them. Therefore, that which experiences pleasure and pain cannot be said to be just one jeev. Furthermore, the three types of karmas – sanchit karmas, prarabdha karmas, and kriyaman karmas – cannot be said to apply to just one jeev. Furthermore, in the past, when Narad and the others attained kalyan, only their own jeev attained kalyan, but there is no mention of the jeevs of the twenty-four tattvas attaining kalyan as well."
34.6 By using such logic, Shreeji Maharaj proved the tattvas to be without a jeev. He then logically disproved each answer given by the paramhans. As a result, the paramhans were unable to answer the question in any way at all.
34.7 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Allow me to answer the question. Due to the indifference between an effect and its cause, there are two types of tattvas. The tattvas that are in the form of cause are chaitanya, and the tattvas that are in the form of the effect are jad. In actuality, the jeev resides in the heart; but through its power of consciousness, it behaves with oneness with the body, the indriyas, and the antah-karans. As a result, the body, the indriyas, and the antah-karans appear to be chaitanya; but, in reality, they are jad.
34.8 "When that jeev becomes a bhakta of Bhagvan and attains the dham of Bhagvan, the tattvas that are jad are left behind. Now, as those twenty-four tattvas are produced from Maya, they are forms of Maya and are jad; they appear differently in the form of the body, the indriyas, and the antah-karans. For example, there is one pruthvi that assumes the five forms of the skin, flesh, marrow, bones, and muscles. Due to the skill of the maker, it also comes in the form of glass. In the same way, that Maya, due to the will of Bhagvan, appears in different forms (the body, the indriyas, and the antah-karans)."

Gadhada II – 35
Upasana Is Required To Attain Kalyan
35.1 In the Samvat year 1880, two-and-a-half hours before sunrise on Bhadarva sud 11 [16th September 1823], Shreeji Maharaj awoke from sleep and sat on a decorated bedstead that had been placed over the underground store of grains in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white pachhedi. He had also tied a black-bordered cloth around His head.
35.2 At that time, Shreeji Maharaj summoned all the paramhans and bhaktas. Then, addressing them, He began, "I slept very soundly last night, and though I tried very hard to awake, I could not. During that sleep, I thought a great deal. I have made a decision based upon these thoughts, which I shall now tell you."
35.3 He then said, "Even before I met Ramanand Swami, I could see my atma as if it were before my eyes, and I also see it now. That atma is luminous with light like that of the sun. Even amidst the activities of all my indriyas, I do not lose awareness of that atma for even a moment.
35.4 "In actual fact, such atma- nishtha is very difficult to attain. Only a fortunate person who has sanskars of many past lives is able to attain such atma- nishtha, whereas if someone else were to think about the atma for even a hundred years, he would still not attain atma-nishtha.
35.5 "So, how can a person attain atma- nishtha? Well, when a person performs dhyan upon the murti of Shree Krishna Bhagvan, it is not at all difficult to attain kalyan. Conversely, no one should even hope of understanding or seeing the atma by merely thinking about it without performing dhyan upon Bhagvan. However, by the upasana of Bhagvan, narrating His charitras, chanting His holy name, and following dharma, it is not at all difficult for the jeev to attain kalyan; it is an easy path – like crossing the ocean by sitting in a boat. In contrast, to attain kalyan through atma- nishtha is a difficult path – like tying gourds to the body and trying to cross the ocean.
35.6 "The only reason why I deliver such talks about knowledge of the atma is that if a person can realise his atma to be distinct from the body, then he will no longer have any love for his body or for his relatives. Then, there would no longer be any obstacles in the bhakti of Bhagvan. This is the only reason; but a person should not think that it is possible to attain kalyan by the knowledge of the atma alone.
35.7 "Also, there are sayings in the world such as, 'If the mind is pure, then a vessel of water is as good as Ganga-water'. So, if the mind is pure, there is no need to bathe in the Ganga to become pure. However, these words are not true. Regardless of how much a person may have mastered samadhi, or how thoughtful he may be, if he begins to stay in the close company of women, there is no way in which he could maintain his dharma. Similarly, regardless of how strict a woman may be in observing dharma, if she stays in the close company of men, then she would also in no way be able to maintain her dharma. Therefore, no one should believe that men and women can stay in each other's company and still be able to maintain their dharma. This fact is true, and no one should doubt it.
35.8 "When can a person maintain his dharma? Only if those who are paramhans and brahm-charis abide by the niyams prescribed for them, such as brahm-charya, will they be able to maintain their dharma. The same is true for women; only if they abide by the niyams prescribed for them will they be able to maintain their dharma as well. In the same way, if all other satsangi grahasthas abide by the niyams prescribed for them – including not staying in an isolated place with even his young mother, sister, or daughter; and not extensively looking at them either – then they will also be able to maintain their dharma.
35.9 "In this way, following dharma, upasana of the svarup of Bhagvan, listening to and narrating the charitras of Bhagvan's avatars, and chanting His holy name, are the four qualities that are fundamentally necessary for the jeev's kalyan.
35.10 "Indeed, all of you realise me to be Bhagvan. So, wherever I have organised festivals; wherever all the paramhans and brahm-charis, male and female satsangi bhaktas have gathered; when I have had kirtans sung; when I have delivered talks; and when my puja had been performed, all such leelas and charitras should be narrated, heard, and thought about in the mind. If a person remembers these during his last moments, his jeev will certainly attain the dham of Bhagvan. In this way, all of my leelas and charitras, as well as the chanting of my name, are kalyan-kari. When I explained this to Svarupanand Swami, the agonising pain in his body due to illness was completely relieved, and he felt profound peace. In fact, he could see his own atma very well, yet it was of no use.
35.11 "A person should also narrate the listen to the charitras of the previous avatars of Bhagvan, such as Ram and Krishna, wherever those charitras may have taken place.
35.12 "It is for the purpose of consolidating those four qualities in you that I described the importance of the eight shastras, like Shreemad Bhagvat. Therefore, the shastras should be read and studied; and only those four qualities should be emphasised.
35.13 "Also, understand that to try to attain kalyan by only observing dharma without the other three qualities – upasana of Bhagvan's murti, narrating and listening to Bhagvan's charitras, and chanting His holy name – would be as difficult as trying to cross the ocean after tying gourds to the body. Yet, though a person has refuge of the murti of Bhagvan; though he narrates and listens Bhagvan's leelas and charitras; and though he chants the name of Bhagvan, if he does not observe dharma, he should be known to be as foolish as a person who tries to cross the ocean carrying a stone slab upon his head; he should also be known to be like an outcast.
35.14 "Therefore, a jeev can attain kalyan only by those four qualities. Without them, there are no other means by which a person can attain kalyan. However, a person should only listen to and sing the kirtans and poems written by Muktanand Swami and other sadhus. Kirtans and poems composed by other poets can also be heard and sung if they describe the leelas and charitras of Bhagvan. However, poems and kirtans like those composed by the likes of Kabir and akha should not be sung or heard."
35.15 Concluding, Shreeji Maharaj said, "All of you have faith in me. If I were to mislead you with unfounded talks, it would amount to throwing all of you into a well and sealing it with a stone slab so that there would be no hope of escape. However, if you are misled along the wrong path because of your faith in my words, then what good would that be to me? Therefore, these talks are for the sake of your kalyan. I have told you this out of love for all of you, so now all of you should understand it and strictly live by it."
35.16 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj finally added, "Now, if you have decided to act according to the talk which I have just delivered, then come forward one by one and touch my feet. While doing so, take an oath and pledge, 'I definitely want to behave accordingly'."
35.17 Then, all the paramhans and satsangis happily got up and touched Shreeji Maharaj's holy feet and bowed before Him. He then told the ladies to do the same. So, standing at a distance, the ladies also pledged and took an oath to behave accordingly. Shreeji Maharaj was very pleased with this. Then, He retired to His residence.

Gadhada II – 36
Maintaining Continuous Vrutti
36.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Bhadarva sud Punam [30th September 1823], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
36.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Please conduct a question-answer discussion."
36.3 Then, Muktanand Swami asked a question: "By what means can a person continuously engage his vrutti on Bhagvan?"
36.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Actually, there are four methods to achieve this. Of these, the first method is that the chitt has a tendency of becoming engrossed; so it can become engrossed in everything. So, just as it becomes engrossed in a person's son or wife, it can also become engrossed in Bhagvan. Therefore, that is one method.
36.5 "The second method is to be extremely brave. When a person with such bravery in his heart conceives some desirous thought other than that of Bhagvan, as he is a brave bhakta, intense thinking arises within which dispel all desirous thoughts. Therefore, he continuously engages his vrutti on the svarup of Bhagvan.
36.6 "The third method is fear. If extreme fear of birth, death, Narak, and the cycle of births and deaths exists in a person's heart, he continuously engages his vrutti on the svarup of Bhagvan due to fear.
36.7 "The fourth method is vairagya. A person with vairagya – through gnan of the Sankhya shastras – realises his own atma to be distinct from the body; and except for that atma, he realises all worldly objects to be asatya. Following this, he beholds Paramatma within his atma and continuously thinks about Him.
36.8 "With the exception of a person on whom Bhagvan bestows His grace – regarding which nothing can be said – people may attempt countless other means, but without resorting to these four methods, a person will not be able to continuously engage his vrutti on Bhagvan. Of course, continuously engaging the vrutti on Bhagvan is an extremely difficult achievement. It is only possible by those whose good deeds from many lives have ripened. For others, it is very difficult, indeed."
36.9 Having described how to continuously engage the vrutti on Bhagvan's svarup, Shreeji Maharaj added, "In this world, everyone talks of maya. I have seen the characteristics of that maya as follows: Love for anything other than Bhagvan is itself maya. In fact, the love a person has towards his own body and his relatives and towards the person who provides for his body, exceeds even the extreme love a person has for the panch-vishays. Therefore, a person who has eradicated love for his body, his relations, and those who provide for his body is said to have risen above Bhagvan's maya. In fact, a person who eradicates love for everyone other than Bhagvan develops love towards Bhagvan. Then, when love for Bhagvan is developed, his vrutti continuously remains on Bhagvan. When that is achieved, he has nothing further to achieve; he has become fulfilled."

Gadhada II – 37
Eradicating A Svabhav
37.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Bhadarva vad 1 [21st September 1823], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, a sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
37.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "In the Geeta, it is said that even a person possessing gnan behaves according to his svabhavs, and not even the strength of self-control mentioned in the shastras is effective in such cases. Then, how can such svabhavs be eradicated?"
37.3 All the munis thought over the question, but they were unable to answer it.
37.4 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "The answer to that is as follows: When a s at-purush gives guidance on how to eradicate such svabhavs, if a person has total faith in those words; if he has deep love for the sat-purush giving the guidance; and if he accepts those words to be for his own benefit no matter how painfully strong these s at-purush's words seem, then his svabhavs will be eradicated. Except for this, there is no other method. Therefore, regardless of how much Bhagvan or the sat-purush insults him for the purpose of eradicating his svabhavs, and regardless of the harsh words they may utter, a person who wishes to eradicate his svabhavs should not feel hurt in any way and should consider only the qualities of the person advising him. If a person behaves in this way, then that svabhav, which otherwise could not be eradicated in any way, is eradicated."

Gadhada II – 38
Mancha Bhakta And The Alchemist
38.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Bhadarva vad 6 [26th September 1823], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, a sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
38.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "If a worldly person were to come across someone who could grant him wealth or a son, he would immediately develop faith in that person. However, a bhakta of Bhagvan never has faith in charms and spells, in witchcraft or in vulgar, dramatic performances. If he were to have faith in charms, spells, or witchcraft, then even though he may be a satsangi, he should be considered to be half vimukh.
38.3 "Having said this, there are not many true bhaktas of Bhagvan. Nonetheless, Mancha Bhakta of Kariyani was indeed a true bhakta of Bhagvan. Prior to joining the satsang, he was in the Margi sect. However, in no way did he lapse in his observance of the vow of nishkam; instead, he remained a brahm- charya from his childhood.
38.4 "Once, an alchemist was staying at his house. After demonstrating how he could transform copper into sliver, the alchemist told Mancha Bhakta, 'Because you are very charitable, I shall teach you this spell and show you how to transform copper into sliver'. However, Mancha Bhakta threatened him with a stick and drove him out of the village, telling him, 'I have no desire for anything except Bhagvan'. Afterwards, when Mancha Bhakta joined satsang, he became an ek a ntik bhakta of Bhagvan."
38.5 Continuing, Shreeji Maharaj said, "An ekantik bhakta would firstly possess atma-nishtha; secondly, he would possess vairagya; thirdly, he would be strict in following dharma; and fourthly, he would possess profound bhakti for Shree Krishna Bhagvan. When such an ekantik bhakta abandons his physical body, he 'merges' into Shree Krishna Bhagvan, whereas a person who is not ekantik 'merges' into Brahma and the other devs or into Sankarshan, Aniruddha, or Pradyumna. However, without attaining the ekantik state, a person cannot 'merge' into Shree Krishna Bhagvan.
38.6 "Such 'merging' should be understood as follows: A person who is very greedy is said to 'merge' into money; a person who is very lustful is said to 'merge' into the woman he is fond of; and when a person who is very rich but childless receives a son, he is said to 'merge' into his son. In this way, a person should be known as having 'merged' into whatever he is attached to. However, this 'merging' is not like that of water merging with water or like fire merging with fire.
38.7 "If a bhakta has 'merged' into his ishta-dev, he would never develop love for anything else except his ishta-dev. In fact, he would continuously think of Him. If he were forced to live without his ishtadev, he would live life in days of deep misery; but, in no way would he be happy."

Gadhada II – 39
Behaving According To Natural Qualities
39.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Bhadarva vad 10 [29th September 1823], Shreeji Maharaj arrived at Lakshmi-Vadi on horseback from Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. There, He sat on a decorated bedstead that had been placed on the platform. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
39.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please reveal to me the qualities which are natural to you – qualities which do not decrease even under the influence of unpleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang."
39.3 Shreeji Maharaj then began Himself, "Here, let me first tell you the qualities that are natural to me." He then said, "Firstly, it is my nature that regardless of how much physical contact of the panch-vishays I encounter, I do not have any desire for them in my mind – not even in my dreams.
39.4 "Secondly, regardless of how much pravrutti I may be physically involved in, when I look within towards my atma, all my vruttis withdraw into my atma – just like a tortoise withdraws its limbs – and I experience profound bliss.
39.5 "Thirdly, I have a very strong belief that Bhagvan possesses a svarup. I believe that Shree Krishna Vasudev resides in His Akshardham – which is full of chaitanya and full of divine light – and possesses an eternal and definite svarup. Bhagvan is also the all-doer, since that which is nirakar can accomplish nothing. In fact, my belief that Bhagvan possesses a svarup is so firm that even though I have read and heard many Vedant shastras, my belief has not been changed.
39.6 "Fourthly, if I come to know of any man or woman that is pretentiously offering bhakti to Bhagvan merely as an outward show, and that person is not a genuine bhakta of Bhagvan, then my mind is not pleased upon seeing such a person. Also, I never feel comfortable with that person, because my mind only becomes pleased when I see a genuine bhakta of Bhagvan, and I am only comfortable with such people.
39.7 "I have described to you these four qualities that are natural to me. Now, all of you may tell me yours."
39.8 Then, the senior paramhans and bhaktas described the qualities they possessed.
39.9 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "For those who are senior amongst you, the observance of the vow of nishkam is an absolute must. It may be fine if a person has a deficiency in some other aspect, but firmness in nishkam is absolutely essential, as the example set by the seniors is what is followed by everyone else."
39.10 After delivering this talk, Shreeji Maharaj returned to Dada Khachar's darbar, performed the arti, and joined in the 'Narayan' dhun and prayers. Then, a sabha of all the sadhus and bhaktas was held there.
39.11 At that time, Shreeji Maharaj asked the senior paramhans, "I have greatly explained the importance of the fifth and tenth skandhs of the Shreemad Bhagvat. Now, I would like all of you to explain the fundamental principle of those two skandhs as you have come to understand it."
39.12 All the senior paramhans offered explanations according to their own understanding.
39.13 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Here, allow me to tell you the fundamental principle of those two skandhs. But first of all, what can be called a fundamental principle? Well, when a fundamental principle is explained to even the most learned scholars, scriptural readers, or highly intelligent people, they would have to agree with it. In no way could they doubt, 'This might not be so'. That is what can be called a fundamental principle.
39.14 "Now, the fundamental principle of the tenth skandh is as follows: He whom the Upanishads (Vedant) and the Shrutis and Smrutis describe as being brahm, luminous, the embodiment of gnan, the essence, subtle; and who is described as niranjan, kshetragna, the cause of all, Parbrahm, Purushottam, Vasudev, Vishnu, Narayan, and nirgun – is this pratyaksha svarup of Shree Krishna Vasudev, the son of Vasudev. Therefore, wherever there are passages containing shloks in the tenth skandh, the words of those shloks refer to this pratyaksha svarup of Shree Krishna Bhagvan; there is no mention of anyone more superior to Shree Krishna Bhagvan. The tenth skandh also mentions that only Shree Krishna Bhagvan is the cause of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the whole universe.
39.15 "The greatness of Shree Krishna Bhagvan is narrated in the fifth skandh. Also mentioned are the many different svarups assumed by Shree Krishna Bhagvan in various khands for the sustenance of the world and for the sake of bestowing bliss upon his bhaktas. In addition, all those who abide by the niyams prescribed by Shree Krishna Bhagvan attain a great status, whereas those who do not abide by those niyams fall from their status, even if they are great. It is also said that if a common person disobeys those niyams, he will certainly fall back.
39.16 "That same Shree Krishna Vasudev, who as a child gave the spectacular darshan of the pratyaksha four-armed svarup to Vasudev and Devki, is in fact the svarup of the eternal Vasudev.
39.17 "Furthermore, that Shree Krishna Bhagvan had behaved according to dharma, arth, and kam. All those who narrate or even listen to the charitras of Bhagvan in which He followed dharma, arth, and kam, will be released from all of their sins and will attain Akshardham. Also, the birth, actions, and murti of that Vasudev Bhagvan are all divya. In fact, and Vasudev Bhagvan alone is sarvopari.
39.18 "This is the fundamental principle of those two skandhs. Even those who have attained the brahm-rup state, like Shukji, must also worship and offer bhakti to Shree Krishna Bhagvan. Also, as mentioned in the tenth skandh, even those like Shukji should narrate and listen to the charitras of Bhagvan. In fact, Shukji himself has said, parinishthitopi nairgunya uttam-shloka-leelaya gruheeta-cheta rajarshe akhyanam yad-adheetavan : O King (Parikshit)! Despite being perfectly poised in the nirgun state, having been attracted by the leelas of Bhagvan, I (Shukdevji) studied the Shreemad Bhagvat.
39.19 "A person should also keep a firm belief regarding the svarup of that Vasudev Bhagvan. If a person has a firm belief of the svarup of Bhagvan, and if he happens to commit some sin, then he will be freed of that sin – because there is always some form of prayshchit prescribed for committing a sin. However, to realise Bhagvan as nirakar is a sin much greater than even the five great sins. There is no prayshchit for that sin.
39.20 "Conversely, if a person realises Bhagvan to possess a sakar and has a firm belief of this, then even if he happens to commit a sin, there is nothing to worry about. By the grace of Bhagvan, all of those sins will be burnt and his jeev will attain Bhagvan.
39.21 "Therefore, a person should keep a firm belief of the svarup of Bhagvan and firmly worship Him. This is my message to you. So, please remember these words firmly in your lives."
39.22 Having given this advice to everyone, Shreeji Maharaj departed to have His meal.

Offering One Extra Dandvat
40.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on aso vad 3 [22nd October, 1823], Shreeji Maharaj was in His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. After bathing, he put on white clothes, and sat upon His seat. Then, after completing His daily routine of performing puja of Bhagvan, He was performing dandvats in the northern direction to Shree Krishna Bhagvan. It so happened that on that day, He performed one dandvat more than usual.
40.2 Noticing this, Shuk Muni asked, "Maharaj, why did you perform one extra dandvat today?"
40.3 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "Everyday, after bowing to Shree Krishna Bhagvan, I used to pray, 'Maharaj, if any feelings of 'I-ness' and 'my-ness' for this body and its relations exist, then please eradicate them'. However, today the following thought occurred to me: 'No other sin causes more misery to a person than when he somehow – knowingly or unknowingly – harms a bhakta of Bhagvan by thought, word, or deed'. Therefore, I performed one extra dandvat to make up for any mistake that may have occurred of knowingly or unknowingly harming some bhakta of Bhagvan by thought, word, or deed.
40.4 "I have come to the conclusion that the extent of damage and misery incurred as a result of harming a bhakta of Bhagvan is not incurred by any other sin. On the other hand, there is no spiritual activity that benefits a person and gives as much happiness as that of serving a bhakta of Bhagvan by thought, word, and deed.
40.5 "It is because of the influence of lobh, man, irshya, and krodh that a person harms a bhakta of Bhagvan. Only a person who does not possess these four inner enemies can respect a bhakta of Bhagvan. Therefore, a person who wishes to experience supreme happiness in this very body and also experience supreme happiness after death should never harm a bhakta of Bhagvan by thought, word, or deed.
40.6 "However, if a person does somehow harm a bhakta of Bhagvan, then he should verbally pray to him for forgiveness; and physically and mentally, he should perform dandvats before him and determine to never harm him again. However, he should not behave in such a way that he performs dandvats after harming someone once, only to then harm him again and perform dandvats again.
40.7 "So that you remember this fact daily, from today, all sadhus and all bhaktas should observe the following vow: After performing puja of Bhagvan, a person should perform dandvats according to his daily practice. After this, to make up for knowingly and unknowingly harming a bhakta of Bhagvan during the day, by thought, word, or deed, he should perform one extra dandvat every day. This is my agna; so please do abide by it."

A Bone Is The Form Of Man
41.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Kartik vad 11 [28th November, 1823], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a large decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. He was wearing garlands of yellow flowers around His neck, and tassels of yellow flowers had been inserted in His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
41.2 Out of compassion, Shreeji Maharaj then began to preach to His bhaktas, saying, "When a person who wishes to worship Bhagvan receives an opportunity to serve Bhagvan and His bhaktas, he should serve them considering it to be his extremely great fortune. Moreover, he should do so only with bhakti, for the sake of pleasing Bhagvan and for his own kalyan – not for the sake of receiving praise from others.
41.3 "However, the nature of a person is such that he only enjoys doing that which satisfies his pride. Without that, he does not enjoy performing even bhakti of Bhagvan. For example, a dog takes a dry bone to an isolated place to chew on. As a result of the chewing, its mouth is grazed and the bone becomes covered in blood. Then, licking the bone, the dog becomes overjoyed. But, little does the fool realise, 'The taste that I am enjoying is that of the blood from my own mouth'. In the same way, even a bhakta of Bhagvan is unable to abandon the bone (pride). In fact, all the spiritual activities he performs are governed by pride; they are not performed for the sole purpose of pleasing Bhagvan, while thinking of them as bhakti towards Bhagvan. Moreover, of all the bhakti that he does offer to Bhagvan, he does so only when it nourishes his pride, but not for the sole purpose of pleasing Bhagvan.
41.4 "There must be very few bhaktas like Ratanji and Miyaji who offer bhakti to Bhagvan solely for the purpose of pleasing Bhagvan without any cravings for praise. However, not everyone is capable of abandoning the taste of praise."
41.5 In reference to this, Muktanand Swami recited a verse by Tulsidas: kanak tajyo kamini tajyo, tajyo dhatuko sang tulsi laghu bhojan kari, jeeve man ke rang. Tulsi says: he has abandoned women, wealth, and possessions. But, he lives on praise alone, the greatest of all obsessions.
41.6 Hearing this verse, Shreeji Maharaj added, "The enjoyment which a person experiences from pride cannot be obtained from any other object. Therefore, amongst all bhaktas, a person who abandons pride and worships Bhagvan should be known to be an extremely great bhakta."

Sagun And Nirgun Aspects Of Akshar
42.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Magshar vad 12 [29th December, 1823], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
42.2 Then, Bhagvadanand Swami asked Shreeji Maharaj, "In what way do countless millions of brahmands dwell within each and every pore of Bhagvan? Also, where in the brahmands do the avatars of Bhagvan occur?"
42.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "There are two aspects of Purushottam Bhagvan's Akshardham. The first is the sagun aspect, and the other is the nirgun aspect. On the other hand, Purushottam Narayan cannot be described as nirgun. The distinction of sagun and nirgun applies only to Akshar.
42.4 "The nirgun aspect Akshar has an extremely subtle svarup, smaller than even an atom, while the sagun svarup is much larger than even the largest of objects. Countless millions of brahmands dwell like mere atoms in each and every hair of that Akshar. It is not that those brahmands become small compared to Akshar; they still remain encircled by the eight barriers ( jad prakruti). But, it is because of the extreme vastness of Akshar that those brahmands appear so small. Take Mount Girnar as an example. Compare to Mount Meru, it appears to be extremely small. However, compared to Mount Loka-Lok, Mount Meru itself appears to be extremely small. In the same way, the brahmands remain exactly as they are, but in comparison to the extreme vastness of Akshar, they appear to be extremely small. This is why they are described as being like atoms.
42.5 "Akshar-Brahm itself is like the sun; when the sun rises, all ten directions can be determined in relation to it. Akshardham is like that; above, below, in all four sides of that Akshar – in all directions – are millions of brahmands.
42.6 "Moreover, Bhagvan forever remains present in that Akshardham; and His wish always prevails. While remaining in Akshardham itself, He takes birth in whatever svarup is required in whichever brahmand. For example, Shree Krishna Bhagvan has only one svarup, but during the ras-leela he assumed as many svarups as there were gopis. In the same way, Purushottam Bhagvan takes birth in whatever svarup is required in whichever brahmand – while at the same time remaining in Akshardham. Actually, He Himself forever dwells in Akshardham. Wherever that svarup of Purushottam resides, is the very centre of Akshardham."

Becoming Brahm- Svarup
43.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Posh sud 4 [5th January, 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was seated on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow at the residence of the bhaktas of Ayodhya in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Premanand Swami was singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a saroda.
43.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Let us conduct a question-answer discussion." So, Shreeji Maharaj Himself asked, "A bhakta of Bhagvan who is gunatit behaves only as the atma, above the influence of the three guns – above sattva-gun in the form of vairagya, above rajo-gun in the form of desires for vishays, and above tamo-gun in the form of passiveness. He has absolutely no thoughts, and experiences a state like sushupti. Now, does such a nirgun bhakta who behaves as the atma in this way have love for Bhagvan, or not? That is the question."
43.3 Muktanand Swami replied, "A person who behaves as the atma does have love for Bhagvan."
43.4 Hearing the reply, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Is the love of a bhakta, who behaves as the atma, of the same qualities as the atma, or different?"
43.5 Muktanand Swami replied, "That love has the same qualities as the atma."
43.6 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "Regarding the love developed for Bhagvan while behaving as the atma, Madhav-acharya, Nimbark, and Vallabh-acharya have all described that love as brahm-svarup. Therefore, only a person who has love for Bhagvan having become gunatit brahm-svarup. Such is the principle of the great acharyas."

The Characteristics Of Religious And Demonic People
44.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Posh sud 8 [9th January, 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
44.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked Muktanand Swami, "When a person perceives an avgun in a bhakta, does that person perceive the same amount of avgun in that bhakta as he had noticed previously, or does he perceive more avgun?"
44.3 Muktanand Swami replied, "Apparently, he perceives the same amount of avgun as he previously perceived."
44.4 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "You have missed the point of the question. If he perceives exactly the same amount of avgun, then how can you say that he has perceived an avgun? In actual fact, it is due to the influence of unpleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang, that his intellect becomes spoiled; and that is why he perceives more avgun. In this situation, a person should realise that the blemish of unpleasant circumstances has ruined his intellect.
44.5 "Moreover, I personally feel, 'If a person previously has kept the company of the great sant or has had the darshan of Bhagvan, then he will only perceive his own avgun but will never perceive avgun in any other bhakta of Bhagvan'. A person with such characteristics should be known to be religious.
44.6 "On the other hand, a person who is demonic never perceives even a single avgun within himself; instead, he perceives only avgun in other bhaktas. A person with such an intellect should be known to be demonic. If such a demonic person happens to be in satsang, or if he stays in the company of sadhus, he will be similar to Kalnemi, Ravan, and Rahu; but, he will not be influenced by the company of sadhus.
44.7 "Therefore, a person who is a strict bhakta of Bhagvan perceives only his own avgun; he never notices the avgun of other bhaktas."

The agna Of Remaining Attentive
45.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Posh vad 1 [17th January, 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
45.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "All of you munis, brahm-charis, satsangi grahasthas, parshads, and the bhaktas of Ayodhya are said to be mine. So, if I was not attentive in having all of you behave accordingly, and if you were to then behave waywardly, I would not be able to tolerate this. In actual fact, I do not want even the slightest imperfection to remain in those who are said to be mine. However, you should also remain very attentive, because if you allow even a little carelessness, your footing in satsang will not last.
45.3 "Furthermore, as you are bhaktas of Bhagvan, I do not wish to leave any form of improper svabhavs within your hearts. Also, I do not wish to allow any trace of any of Maya's three gun, ten indriyas, ten prans, four antah-karans, five bhuts, panch-vishays, and the devs of the fourteen loks to remain. Instead, I wish to make all of you such that you offer bhakti to Bhagvan and realise your true svarup to be the atma, which is eternal and is free from all of these mayik flaws. In fact, I wish not to allow any influence of maya to remain within you. If all of your imperfections are not eradicated in this very lifetime, then I will take you to Badrikashram, where all of your worldly desires will be burnt to ashes by performing tap; or I will take you to Shvet-Dvip and burn all of your worldly desires to ashes by having you perform tap with the niranna-muktas. However, I do not wish to allow any love for anything except Bhagvan to remain. For this reason, all the bhaktas and munis should remain attentive."
45.4 Having delivered this talk, Shreeji Maharaj returned to His residence.
45.5 Later, in the evening of that same day, Shreeji Maharaj held another sabha. After the arti was completed, He said, "By performing sattvik karmas, a person goes to Dev-Lok; by performing rajas karmas, a person goes to Mrutyu-Lok; and by performing tamas karmas, a person goes to the lower loks. However, someone may doubt, 'If by performing rajas karmas a person attains Mrutyu-Lok, then that suggests that all those of Mrutyu-Lok should experience the same joys and miseries'. So, the answer to this is that although there is only one particular rajo-gun, countless types of distinctions are created within it due to the influence of differing factors, like desh and kal. Therefore, it is not the case that there is one certain type of rajas karma. In actual fact, the type of karmas performed varies according to the factors of desh, kal, kriya, and sang.
45.6 "Having said this, if a person performs some karma which displeases the sant of Bhagvan's or an avatar of Bhagvan, he will suffer miseries similar to those of Yampuri in this very body here in Mrutyu-Lok. On the other hand, if a person performs a karma by which Bhagvan and His bhaktas are pleased, then he will enjoy bliss similar to that of attaining Akshardham in this very body.
45.7 "Furthermore, if a person were to displease Bhagvan and His sant, then despite the fact that he had performed such karmas that would have led him to Svarg, all those karmas would be destroyed and he would instead be sent to Narak. Conversely, if a person were to perform a karma by which Bhagvan and His sant are pleased, then even if he were destined to fall into Narak, all of his impure karmas would be destroyed and he would instead attain Akshardham. Therefore, a person who is wise should behave only in a way that would please Bhagvan and His bhaktas. He should even advise all of his relatives, 'We should behave only in a way that would please Bhagvan and His sant, and in a way by which they would shower their grace upon us'.
45.8 "In fact, Agni must have also pleased Bhagvan and His sant, because only then would he have attained his light. Surya, Chandra, and all others who possess light, must also have pleased Bhagvan and His sant by performing religious karmas, as only then would they have attained such light. In fact, all of those who are happy in Dev-Lok and Mrutyu-Lok must have pleased Bhagvan and His sant, because it is by their grace that they are happy.
45.9 "Therefore, a person who aspires for the good of his own atma should observe the svadharma prescribed in the shastras, and do only that which pleases Bhagvan and His sant."

Gadhada II – 46
Progression and Regression Does Not Affect A Sat-Purush
46.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Posh vad 11 [26th January 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes, and had covered Himself with a yellow rajai made of chhint. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the sadhus were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a jhanjh and mrudang.
46.2 After the singing concluded, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A sat-purush living in this world is not pleased or pained upon seeing the worldly progress or regress of a person. However, when someone's mind falls back from the path of Bhagvan, he does become grieved. After all, life is so short; and if a person's afterlife is ruined, it would indeed be a great loss for that person.
46.3 "In fact, Bhagvan assumes avatars upon earth for the purpose of establishing dharma, and not simply for the establishment of the dharma of a person's varna and ashram. After all, even the acharyas of pravrutti dharma, such as the Saptarshi, have established the dharma of the four varna and ashrams. However, Bhagvan does not assume avatars solely for that purpose; He assumes avatars to develop the dharma of His ekantik bhaktas.
46.4 "For such ekantik bhaktas, leaving the body is not considered to be death; for them, falling from that ekantik dharma is true death. This occurs when a dislike arises in the heart towards Bhagvan or His sant. That bhakta should then be known to have fallen from the dharma of ekantik bhaktas. For example, if he has fallen due to krodh, it should be known that he has received the body of a snake; and if he has fallen due to kam, it should be known that he has taken birth as an evil spirit or a demon.
46.5 "Nevertheless, despite having attained such bodies and having fallen from ekantik dharma, those who observe dharma or perform tap will attain Dev-Lok due to their observance of dharma or their performance of tap. However, a person who has a dislike towards Bhagvan or His sant will certainly not attain the dham of Bhagvan. On the other hand, even if a person has committed the five great sins, if he has not perceived an avgun in Bhagvan or His sant, then his sins will be burned, and he will dwell in the dham of Bhagvan. Therefore, to perceive avgun in Bhagvan and His bhakta is a greater sin than committing the five great sins."

Gadhada II – 47
The Desire To Perform Bhakti After Becoming Brahm-Rup
47.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Maha vad 10 [24th February 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes and had covered Himself with a yellow rajai made of chhint. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
47.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "If a person has a group of sadhus staying with him, and if he can sincerely look after them graciously, those sadhus will happily stay with him. However, if he does not know how to look after them, they will not stay with him.
47.3 "Furthermore, if a sadhu is eager to attain moksh, he would become increasingly overjoyed when I do something that may upset him or when I criticise the vishays. For example, Muktanand Swami has contracted tuberculosis, and so he is restricted from eating yoghurt, milk, and any sweet or fried foods. A wise person would think to himself, 'This disease has restricted all tasty food and drink; therefore I wonder if I have actually attained the company of a great sadhu in the appearance of tuberculosis!' This is how a wise person would view the situation. This is because a person's desires regarding the genitals and the stomach are characteristics of an asat person. However, tuberculosis is disease that removes both flaws. Therefore, a mumukshu should not feel hurt when a s at-purush, in the same way as that disease, criticises vishays.
47.4 "Also, if a person is staying with a senior sadhu due to the temptation of obtaining tasty food or drink, or due to the temptation of obtaining nice clothes, or due to the temptation of collecting objects that he likes, then he should not be considered a sadhu at all. Instead, he should be known to be an extremely wretched person and like a dog. A person who has such corrupt intentions will ultimately fall from satsang.
47.5 "Furthermore, if someone should give a sadhu a nice object, a person who becomes jealous as well as the person who is greedy for the panch-vishays are both much worse than a person who has committed the five great sins. Therefore, a person who is wise should remain in the company of sadhus and not have any impure intentions within. After all, this sabha is like the sabha in Badrikashram and Shvet-Dvip; if a person's worldly desires are not eradicated here, where else will he be able to eradicate them?
47.6 "Moreover, our jeevs have previously indulged in the panch-vishays through countless bodies, as devs and humans. Nevertheless, we have not been happy with those vishays. Therefore, now that we are bhaktas of Bhagvan, indulging in the vishays for a further year, or two years, or maybe even five years will still not fulfil us. It is as if the earth has been split down to Patal, and we begin to fill it with water, it can never be filled. Similarly, the indriyas have never become satisfied by the vishays, and they never will be. So, a person should eradicate his attachment to the vishays. Furthermore, he should consider the qualities of the sadhu who speaks to him harshly and should not think unkindly of him. This is explained in the following kirtan composed by Muktanand Swami: 'Shuli Upar Shayan Karave Toy Sadhu-Ne Sange Rahiye Re...' – a person should remain in the company of sadhus, even if he has to suffer the pain of a shuli. Therefore, a person should take hold of this opportunity and die only after eradicating his impure desires; he should not die with his impure desires still remaining.
47.7 "Having said this though, a person should keep the following desire: 'After leaving this body, I want to become brahm-rup like Narad, the Sanakadik, and Shukji, and offer bhakti to Bhagvan' . During this process, even if he has to go to Brahm-Lok or Indra-Lok, there is nothing to worry about. For example, if a person goes to answer the call of nature, and then falls headfirst into the gutter, he should take a bath and become pure again; he should not remain in the filth. Similarly, if a person has pure desires and as a result attains Brahm-Lok or Indra-Lok, he should think, 'I have fallen headfirst into the gutter'. Thinking in this way, he should discard the pleasures of Brahm-Lok and Indra-Lok using the strength of his pure desires and make his way to the dham of Bhagvan. He should be determined not to stop anywhere in between.
47.8 "Also, just as the grahasthas or tyagis serve us, we should also realise their greatness. For example, Mulji Brahm-Chari realises my greatness and serves me. In the same way, I realise his greatness. Therefore, as the grahasthas serve us by providing food and clothes, we should also realize their greatness and serve them by preaching to them. In this way, we should develop friendship among bhaktas of Bhagvan by realising the greatness of each other."

'Vandu Sahajanand' - Taking Birth In The Company Of Sant
48.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Maha vad 14 [28th February 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes and was wearing new, white kanthis made from tulsi beads, around His neck. In addition to this, tassels of yellow flowers decorated His pagh, and garlands of flowers were hanging around His neck. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
48.2 In the sabha, Premanand Swami was singing ' Vandu Sahajanand Ras Rup, Anupam Sar-Ne Re Lol...' – kirtans useful for dhyan. After he had finished singing, Shreeji Maharaj commented, "The kirtans you sang were very wonderful. After listening to them I thought in my mind, 'Since this sadhu thinks about Bhagvan's svarup in this way, let me get up and perform dhyan before him'.
48.3 "If a person is able to think about Bhagvan in his antah-karans in this way, and if he were to die while still holding such a desire for Bhagvan, he would definitely not have to take another birth. If he engages in such dhyan of Bhagvan, he has certainly attained Akshardham while alive. In addition, he can be said to be in the process of becoming a niranna-mukta just like the niranna-muktas in Shvet-Dvip. Such a person performs the bodily activities that are necessary without effort. In fact, a person who is able to think about Bhagvan's svarup like this has become fulfilled and has nothing more left to achieve.
48.4 "On the other hand, if a person dies while thinking about things other than Bhagvan, there will be no end to his miseries for countless millions of years. So, now that such an opportunity has arisen, a person should seize it and, after discarding any thoughts about objects other than Bhagvan, should think about His svarup only.
48.5 "However, if a person is unable to think about Bhagvan's svarup, he should remain in the company of a sadhu who possesses dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti. As for myself, I have only this desire within: 'When I abandon this body, although there will be no reason for me to take birth again, I feel in my heart that I should make a reason and take birth in the company of such sadhus'. This is all I wish for.
48.6 "However, if a person is able to think about Bhagvan as described in the above kirtan, then he is freed from the bondage of Kal, karma, and Maya. In fact, regardless of the family in which he person happens to be born, his parents should also be considered to be fulfilled. Conversely, a person who thinks about the vishays, and does not think of Bhagvan, should be considered as being totally lost.
48.7 "After all, regardless of the life-form in which a person takes birth, he will be able to have a wife, a son, and possessions such as wealth and other objects. However, the company of a sadhu who is knower of brahm, as well as the direct darshan and thought of Shree Vasudev Bhagvan are extremely rare. Therefore, there is no greater advantage of possessing this human body than being able to constantly think about Bhagvan in the heart – just as a person engrossed in the vishays constantly think about them in the antah-karans. Such a person is also the greatest amongst all bhaktas of Bhagvan. Even if he does indulge in the panch-vishays, all would be related only to Bhagvan. His ears wish to continuously listen to talks related to Bhagvan; his skin wishes to touch Bhagvan; his eyes with to have the darshan of Bhagvan and His sant; his tongue wishes to taste the prasad of Bhagvan; and his nose wishes to smell the fragrance of flowers and tulsi which have been offered to Bhagvan. Apart from Bhagvan, he considers nothing else to be a source of happiness. A person who behaves in this way, can be called an ekantik bhakta of Bhagvan."

Differences Between Bhagvan's Svarup And Mayik Svarups
49.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Fagan sud 2 [1st March 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing medi in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes, and a garland of white flowers was hanging from His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
49.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "There is a great difference between the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan and mayik svarup. However, those who are ignorant and those who are utter fools consider Bhagvan's svarup and mayik svarups to be the same. Those who see mayik svarups and those who think about mayik svarups spend countless millions of years wandering in the cycle of births and deaths. In the comparison, those who do the darshan of Bhagvan's svarup and those who think about it, escape from the bondage of Kal, karma, and, Maya; attain Akshardham; and become parshads of Bhagvan. It is for this reason that my mind never becomes full with kathas, kirtans, talks related to Bhagvan, or dhyan of Bhagvan. All of you should also do the same."

The Fundamental Principle - Love For A Sant
50.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on the night of Chaitra vad 2 [15th April 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the west-facing medi in front of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
50.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "As I consider all of you to be mine, today I am going to reveal to you my fundamental principle." He then continued, "Just as rivers merge into the sea, just as a sati and a moth burn in a fire, and just as the brave sacrifice themselves on the battlefield, in the same way, I have kept my atma absorbed in the pure and perfect brahm. I have also forever attached myself with undying love to Purushottam Bhagvan – who possesses a definite svarup – and to His bhaktas dwelling in the radiant Akshardham. In fact, I have no love for anything other than them. This is what I constantly experience.
50.3 "Outwardly, I do not make a display of the intensity of my tyag. However, when I look into my heart and towards the hearts of other bhaktas, even the senior paramhans and senior sankhya-yogi women all seem to have some trace of the world remaining – whereas worldly desires never arise in my heart; not even in my dreams. It also seems to me that no one is capable of making me falter from my bhakti towards Bhagvan and His bhaktas.
50.4 "In addition, even before a person had been graced with the attainment of Bhagvan, Kal (a power of Bhagvan) was unable to destroy the jeev; karmas were unable to destroy the jeev; not even Maya was able to absorb the jeev within itself. So, having attained Bhagvan, why should a person worry about Kal, karma, and Maya? Bearing this in mind, I have become determined that I do not want to develop love for anyone except Bhagvan and His bhaktas.
50.5 "Furthermore, I do not wish to leave any trace of the world in the hearts of whosoever keeps my company. This is because I only get along with those whose determination is similar to mine. However, if a person has desires for worldly pleasures, that even if I try to develop love for that person, I cannot do so. Therefore, only those bhaktas of Bhagvan who are free of worldly desires are dear to me. What I have just told you is my personal principle."
50.6 In this way, Shreeji Maharaj talked to His bhaktas for the sake of their enlightenment.

The Characteristics Of A Person Who Behaves As The atma
51.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on the night of Chaitra vad 9 [22nd April 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the south-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
51.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked the paramhans, "Often, when the jeev enters sushupti, it experiences profound peace, whereas at other times, even when it enters sushupti, its restlessness does not subside. What is the reason for this? That is my question."
51.3 The senior paramhans attempted to answer the question, but were unable to give a precise answer.
51.4 So, Shreeji Maharaj explained, "That is due to the increase of the force of rajo-gun. So, even during the state of sushupti, the disturbance of rajo-gun joins with tamo-gun. As a result, a person experiences a feeling of restlessness even within sushupti. Therefore, as long as the influence of the gun remains within a person, he will never experience happiness; he only becomes happy when he behaves as the atma."
51.5 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "What are the characteristics of someone who behaves as the atma?"
51.6 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "No one is said to be as powerful as Shiv and Brahma. In fact, they are the gurus of even Narad; it is difficult for others to behave as they do – as brahm-svarup. Having said that, when the eight factors of desh, kal, kriya, sang, dhyan, mantra, diksha, and shastra became unpleasant, the harmful influence caused great distress in the hearts of even Shiv and Brahma. Therefore, regardless of how nirgun a person may be, or even if he behaves as the atma, if he encounters unpleasant circumstances, he will most certainly experience distress within. So, no one can ever become happy by disobeying the disciplines laid down by the great sant.
51.7 "For this reason, all tyagis should abide by the dharma of tyagis, all grahasthas should abide by the dharma of grahasthas, and all women should abide by the dharma of women. Even in this, a person will not become happy if he behaves less than what is prescribed; nor will he become happy by behaving beyond what is prescribed. After all, the dharma prescribed in shastras has been written exactly as Bhagvan has narrated; therefore, there can be no discrepancy in it. Moreover, they are prescribed in such a way that they are easy to observe. Therefore, if a person observes too much or too little, he will certainly become unhappy.
51.8 "So, only a person who follows the commands of a s at-purush can be said to be under the influence of pleasant circumstances. To deviate from those commands is the very definition of unpleasant circumstances. Therefore, only a person who follows the commands of a s at-purush is behaving as the atma."

That Which Is Appropriate For A Tyagi And Grahastha - Leave Irshya And Perform Bhakti With Shraddha
52.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Chaitra vad 11 [24th April 1824], Shreeji Maharaj arrived at Lakshmi-Vadi on horseback from Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He sat on a square platform and was dressed entirely in white clothes. He was also wearing a garland of flowers around His neck, and a tassel of flowers decorated His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the munis were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a jhanjh and mrudang.
52.2 After the munis had finished singing, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I wish to speak now, so please listen. In this world, the path of a tyagi and the path of a grahastha are both different. The path of a grahastha is not appropriate for a tyagi, and the path of a tyagi is not appropriate for a grahastha. A person who is wise will realise this, but others will not.
52.3 "Now, I shall explain the distinctions. Wealth and property; elephants and horses; cow and buffaloes; houses and mansions; a wife and children; and lavish clothes and jewellery are all suitable for a grahastha. However, to live in the forest; to keep no clothes except a loincloth; to wear a hat on his head; to shave off his hair, beard, and moustache; to wear saffron-coloured clothes; and to tolerate someone swearing or throwing dust at him are most suitable for a tyagi. However, although these are suitable for a tyagi, they are in fact inappropriate for a grahastha. Therefore, a person who has abandoned the world and become a tyagi should think, 'Which ashram do I belong to?' A wise person should think about this; he should not stray onto some inappropriate path like a fool.
52.4 "Moreover, if a wise person is disciplined by someone, he would in turn consider his qualities. On the other hand, if someone offers some useful advice to a fool, the fool would be offended. In that respect, Mulji Brahm-Chari and Ratanji are never offended; that is why I get along very well with them.
52.5 "Also, I like a person who performs seva with shraddha. Conversely, if someone who does not have shraddha were to bring me a meal, I would not like the food; or if they were to bring some clothes, I would not like to wear them; or if they were to perform my puja, I would not like that puja. However, if someone offers something with shraddha, I like it very much.
52.6 "Furthermore, even if someone offers bhakti with shraddha, if he becomes jealous of someone else who comes to offer bhakti, then I do not like that. Therefore, I very much prefer a person who offers bhakti with shraddha and without jealousy."

Gadhada II – 53
Not Being Able To Perceive Avgun
53.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Vaishakh sud 5 [3rd May 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting upon a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow in His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
53.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The characteristics of moh as described in the shastras are as follows: When moh pervades a person's heart, he simply cannot perceive his own avgun. Therefore, for a person not to perceive his own avgun is the very definition of delusion.
53.3 "Moreover, everyone has extreme pride of the wisdom that they possess, but they do not think, 'I do not even know anything about my own jeev. Is the jeev within this body black, or is it white? Is it long, or is it short?' They know nothing about their own jeev, yet they find avgun in the great sant or in Bhagvan. They feel, 'Although He is a great sant or Bhagvan, this much He is not doing properly'. Though they find avgun in this way, little do the fools realise that Bhagvan sees all the jeevs and ishvars who dwell in the countless millions of brahmands as clearly as He sees a drop of water in His palm. He is also the supporter of countless millions of brahmands; He is the husband of Lakshmi; and He is the creator, sustainer, and destroyer of countless millions of brahmands. Even Shesh, Sharada, Brahma, and other devs are unable to comprehend the extent of His greatness. In fact, even the Veds describe His glory as 'neti neti' implying that the glory of Bhagvan is unparalleled.
53.4 "Therefore, a person who perceives avgun either in Bhagvan's charitras or in His understanding should be known to be a vimukh and a sinner. In fact, he should be considered to be the king of all fools. The understanding of Bhagvan and His bhaktas is beyond this world. Then, how can a person who believes his self to be the body possibly comprehend it?
53.5 "So, it is simply out of foolishness that a person perceives flaws in Bhagvan and His bhaktas and therefore falls from the path of Bhagvan; but Bhagvan's true bhakta, the s at-purush, continues to act in a alokik way."

Gadhada II – 54
Satsang Is The Greatest Spiritual Activity
54.1 In the Samvat year 1880, in the afternoon on Jyeshth sud 7 [3rd June 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj arrived at Lakshmi-Vadi on horseback from Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. After riding the horse for quite some time, He sat down on a square platform. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. He had also tied a black-bordered cloth around His head. In addition to this, a garland of mogra flowers was hanging from His neck, and His pagh was decorated with a tassel of flowers. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
54.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked the munis, "In the twelfth chapter of the eleventh skandh of Shreemad Bhagvat, Shree Krishna Bhagvan has said to Uddhav, 'I am not as pleased by ashtang-yog, sankhya, tyag, vrats, yagna, tap, and yatra, as I am pleased by satsang'. This is what Bhagvan has said. This implies that of all spiritual activities, satsang is the greatest. However, what are the characteristics of a person who regards satsang as the greatest spiritual activity?"
54.3 The munis answered according to their understanding, but none could give a precise answer.
54.4 So, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A person who regards satsang as the greatest spiritual activity is deeply attached only to the sant of Bhagvan. For example, if a king who is childless receives a son in old age, then even if that son swears at the king or misbehaves, like by pulling his moustache, the king would not find faults in him. Even if the son hits another child or causes problems in the village, still the king would never attribute faults to his child. This is because the king is profoundly attached to his son. Likewise, only a person who develops such deep attachment for the bhaktas of Bhagvan has realised satsang to be the most kalyan- kari of all spiritual activities. This fact has been described in the Shreemad Bhagvat: yasyatma-buddhiha kunape tri-dhatuke svadheeha kalatradishu bhauma iyadheeha yat-teertha-buddhiha salile na karhichij-janeshva-bhigneshu sa eva gokharaha : If a person regards the body to be his own self; regards his wife and children to be his own; regards the murtis of Bhagvan made from earth to be respected; and regards water to be sacred like a place of pilgrimage, but does not regard the enlightened bhakta of Bhagvan in this way, then he is the most disgraceful of all animals, a wild donkey. "This verse has stated the fact appropriately."

Perform The Nine Types Of Bhakti After Becoming Brahm-Rup - A Goldsmith's Workshop
55.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Jyeshth sud 11 [7th June 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a large decorate bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He had tied a golden-bordered, white moliyu from Navanagar around His head. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white pachhedi. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the munis were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a jhanjh and mrudang.
55.2 After the munis had finished singing the kirtans, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Just as a person possesses some sort of strength today, he must also have had some trace of it before joining satsang. Therefore, today I would like all of you to describe whatever type of strength you have. To begin, I shall describe the type of strength I have, so please listen.
55.3 "Even when I was a child, I very much enjoyed going to mandirs for darshan, listening to kathas, keeping the company of sadhus, and going on yatra. Then, when I left my home, I did not even like to keep clothes. In fact, I like to stay only in the forest, and I was not the least bit afraid. Even when I came across large snakes, lions, elephants, and countless other types of animals in the forest, there was not the slightest fear of dying in my heart. In this way, I always remained fearless in the dense forest. Thereafter, after travelling to holy places of pilgrimage, I met Ramanand Swami. Only after Ramanand Swami passed away did I begin to keep a little fear; and that was for the sake of satsang.
55.4 "However, the following thought is constantly in my mind: When a person is laid down on his death-bed with death waiting, everyone loses their self-interest in that person. The mind of the person who is dying also becomes dejected from worldly life. In the same way, I also constantly feel as if death is waiting at this moment for me, as well as for others. In fact, I constantly regard each and every worldly object to be perishable and worthless. Never do I make any distinctions such as, 'This is a nice object, and this is a bad object'. All worldly objects appear the same to me. For example, when considering the hairs of the armpit, which can be considered good and which bad? Good or bad, they are all the same. Similarly, all worldly objects appear the same to me.
55.5 "If I do compliment or criticise something, it is only to please the bhaktas of Bhagvan. When I say things such as, 'This is delicious food', or 'These are nice clothes', or 'This is beautiful jewellery', or 'This is a pleasant house', or 'This is a fine horse', or 'This is a beautiful flower', it is only to please that particular bhakta. In fact, all of my activities are for the sake of the bhaktas of Bhagvan; there is not a single activity which I perform for my own personal enjoyment."
55.6 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "The mind of an ekantik bhakta of Bhagvan thinks of only the svarup of Bhagvan; his mouth sings only the praises of Bhagvan; his hands engage only in the seva of Bhagvan and His bhaktas; and his ears listen only to the praises of Bhagvan. In this way, I am able to perform all my activities only after realising them to be a form of bhakti to Bhagvan. Besides the bhakti of Bhagvan, my mind is indifferent to everything else. For example, if the only son of a king dies when the king reaches the age of sixty or seventy, the king would become disinterested in all things. In the same way, I constantly remain disinterested while eating, drinking, mounting a horse, and even when I am pleased or displeased.
55.7 "In addition, a thought also remains within my heart that I am the atma, distinct from the body; I am not like this body. Also, my mind is always cautious, for fear that a portion of maya in the form of rajo-gun and tamo-gun will infiltrate my atma! In fact, I am constantly attentive of that.
55.8 "Now, consider the following analogy of a goldsmith's workshop: If a person takes some pure, twenty-four-carat gold to the goldsmith's workshop, but takes his eyes off of it for even a moment, the goldsmith will extract some of the gold and alloy some silver in its place. Similarly, consider the goldsmith's workshop to be the heart and the goldsmith to be maya. While the goldsmith is sitting within his workshop (heart), he is continuously hammering away with his hammer of desires. Even his wife and children secretly steal some gold if they can get their hands on it. Consider the indriyas and antah-karans to be the wife and children of the goldsmith ( maya); it is they who add silver (three gun, attachment to the panch-vishays, the belief that he is body, and that he has kam, krodh, and lobh) into the gold ( chaitanya). They also extract some gold ( gun, such as dharma, bhakti, gnan, and vairagya).
55.9 "When some gold is extracted and sliver is mixed in its place, the original gold diminishes in purity to become eighteen-carat gold. It can be purified again only after melting. Therefore, the silver of rajo-gun and tamo-gun, which has been mixed into the jeev, should be filtered out. Then, the pure atma (gold) will remain, and no other impurities of maya will be left. This is the thought in which I remain engrossed, day and night.
55.10 "I have therefore described my strength to you. Now, in the same way, please describe your strengths to me."
55.11 Then, the sadhus said, "Maharaj, in no way can there be any impurities of maya in you, as you are divya. The talk you have just delivered also describes our strength; and the thought that you have mentioned is actually what all of us should develop in our lives."
55.12 Having delivered this talk, Shreeji Maharaj bid "Jay Sachidanand" to all and returned to His residence.

Gadhada II – 56
Love Only For Bhagvan
56.1 In the Samvat year 1880, on Ashadh sud 5 [1st July 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him in a sabha. Some of the sadhus were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a dukad and saroda.
56.2 After the singing had finished, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Upon hearing these kirtans, my atma delved into deep thought, from which I have concluded that deep love for Bhagvan is a great thing. Then, I remembered Gopalanand Swami and all the bhaktas who have deep love for Bhagvan; and I could see their love towards Bhagvan in all of their antah-karans and jeevs. Then, I examined my own atma, and it appeared to me that others do not seem to have as much love for Bhagvan as I do. After all, if they were to encounter unpleasant circumstances, then even though they are great, their mind would at least be slightly affected. Therefore, I felt that ultimately their foundation appears to be weak. In fact, if they were to encounter extremely unpleasant circumstances, their love for Bhagvan would not remain stable at all.
56.3 "So, after examining everyone, it seems to me that my position is better; regardless of the extent of unpleasant circumstances that I may encounter, in no way will my antah-karans ever be affected. If a person's love for Bhagvan is true, he never develops love for anything other than Bhagvan. In fact, the essence of all shastras is simply this: Bhagvan is the sole source of eternal bliss and the supreme essence of everything. Excluding Bhagvan, all other objects are absolutely worthless and totally insignificant.
56.4 "If a person does have as much love for other objects as he does for Bhagvan, then his foundation is indeed very weak. Consider the analogy of a piece of lightly dyed cloth. It may look very nice initially, but if water happens to fall on it, and it is then put out to dry in the sun, then it becomes useless. It would become so useless that it would not even remain like a white piece of cloth. In the same way, when a person who has affection for the panch-vishays encounters evil company, a person can never be certain about him.
56.5 "Therefore, to please Bhagvan, a bhakta should totally discard the panch-vishays. He should also abandon any affection for objects which may obstruct his love for Bhagvan."

Gadhada II – 57
A 'Cat-Like' Bhakta
57.1 In the Samvat year 1881, during the even arti on Ashadh sud 6 [2nd July 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. A few torches had been lit. Tassels made of flowers were hanging from the white pagh that had been tied around His head. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him in a sabha. Some of the sadhus were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a dukad and saroda.
57.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please listen, I wish to speak to all of you. When you were singing kirtans, and as I was listening to them, a thought occurred to me, which I shall now share with you. If a person wants to love Bhagvan, he should love Him while believing himself to be the pure atma. What is that atma like? Well, within it there are no obstructions either of Maya or the entities evolved from Maya (the three gun, the body, the indriyas, and the antah-karans). Whatever obstructions seem to be in the atma are due to ignorance. However, no obstructions of any form remain in a person who has totally dispelled them through gnan and vairagya. However, to behave as the atma does not mean to believe himself to be brahm and act waywardly. In actual fact, the purpose of behaving as the atma is to realise, 'I am the atma, and there are obstructions of Maya within me. If that is so, how can there be even the slightest trace of Maya in Paramatma Narayan Vasudev, who is beyond the atma?' For this reason, the quality of atma- nishtha should be firmly developed so that a person does not perceive any fault in Bhagvan.
57.3 "Then, keeping his thought in the midst of the light of the atma, he should destroy anything that tries to disturb him from behaving as the atma. For example, when a lizard comes near the light of an oil lamp, it kills any insect that comes near the light. In the same way, the thought that rests within the light of the atma destroys everything apart from the atma.
57.4 "Furthermore, if a person truly loves Bhagvan, he would never develop love for anything else. If there is an object that appears to be dearer to him than Bhagvan, he would completely discard it. That is true tyag. He would discard that object irrespective of whether it is a significant object or an insignificant object – only that is called tyag. On the other hand, if a person can outwardly give up many other things but cannot discard an object that obstructs him in worshipping Bhagvan, his tyag is useless.
57.5 "Also, do not think that only appealing objects obstruct a person's worship of Bhagvan and insignificant objects do not. After all, the very nature of the jeev is such that some people prefer sweet items, some prefer salty items, some prefer sour items, and some prefer bitter items. Therefore, it is the petty mentality of the jeev that it keeps even the most insignificant objects dearer to it than Bhagvan. However, when a person considers the greatness of Bhagvan, no such object can compare to even a millionth of a fraction of His greatness.
57.6 "If a person has developed love for Bhagvan having thoroughly realised Bhagvan in this way, he would not develop love towards any worldly object, such as the body, and the brahmand. Instead, all worldly objects would become insignificant to him. After all, it was when Chitraketu Raja thoroughly realised the greatness of Bhagvan that he abandoned his ten million wives. He even abandoned his empire, which spanned across the entire country. He ultimately realised, 'Of what value is the pleasure of ten million women before the bliss of Bhagvan? Of what value are the pleasures of an empire spanning the entire country? Of what value are the pleasures of the lok of Indra and the lok of Brahma?'
57.7 "In contrast, a person who has love for some objects other than such a great Bhagvan possesses a very petty mentality. Just as a dog deprives pleasure from taking a dry bone to some isolated place and then licking it, in the same way, a foolish person believes that there are pleasures in such miseries, and therefore develops love for worthless objects. If a bhakta of Bhagvan does have more love for some object than he has for Bhagvan, then he is nothing but a 'cat-like' (deceitful) bhakta. On the other hand, a true bhakta of Bhagvan would definitely not hold anything dearer to him than Bhagvan."
57.8 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "A bhakta of Bhagvan who possesses gnan, vairagya, bhakti, and dharma realises, 'A person who is brave and who walks boldly towards his enemy at the time of battle is indeed truly brave. Conversely, it is pointless when a person who is brave is not utilised in battle, just like wealth that is not spent. Similarly, since I have attained Bhagvan, if I do not talk about kalyan to those who keep my company, then of what use is my gnan?' Bearing this in mind, he would not have any cowardice in talking about Bhagvan – even if some opposition were to arise regarding his preaching."
57.9 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj requested the singing of three verses written by Tulsidas: 'Jaki Lagan Ramso Nahi...', 'Ehi Kahyo Sunu Ved Chahu...', and 'Jaku Priya Na R a m Vaidehi...'.
57.10 Shreeji Maharaj then added, "We should live according to the words mentioned in these verses. While doing so, if some deficiency remains, and if a person were to die at that time, he will still not enter the cycle of births and deaths, nor will he become a ghost. In fact, at the very worst, he will join the ranks of Indra or Brahma; his fate will not be any worse than that. Therefore, a person should fearlessly engage in the worship of Bhagvan."
57.11 At that point, Mulji Brahm-Chari came to call Shreeji Maharaj for His meals, and they both left the sabha together.

Gadhada II – 58
The Flourishing Of A Sampraday
58.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Shravan sud 4 [29th July 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
58.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "How do the sampradays of the great acharyas flourish for a long period of time?"
58.3 Muktanand Swami answered, "Firstly, by the shastras of the sampraday; secondly, by following the dharma of a person's varna and ashram as prescribed in the shastras; and thirdly, by total belief in a person's ishta-dev. A sampraday flourishes by these three factors."
58.4 Shreeji Maharaj then asked the same question to Brahmanand Swami and Nityanand Swami. They also gave the same reply.
58.5 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Here, allow me to answer the question. A sampraday flourishes by knowing the following: The purpose for which the ishta-dev of the sampraday took birth on earth; and after taking birth, the various charitras He performed, as well as the ways in which He behaved. Through His behaviour, dharma as well as the greatness of that ishta-dev is naturally revealed. In this way, a sampraday is advanced by the shastras which narrate the charitras of its i shta-dev from His birth up until His passing away. Regardless of whether those shastras are in Sanskrit or in a different language, only those shastras will advance the sampraday, not others.
58.6 "For example, those who worship Ram Bhagvan will be inspired only by the Valmiki Ramayan ; and those who worship Shree Krishna Bhagvan will be inspired only by the tenth and eleventh skandhs of the Shreemad Bhagvat. The Veds will not inspire those who worship Ram Bhagvan or Shree Krishna Bhagvan. Ultimately, only the shastras of a person's own sampraday will advance the sampraday."
58.7 Having said this, "Shreeji Maharaj then commanded Muktanand Swami: "You too should continuously preach and write shastras related to your sampraday and your ishta-dev for the rest of your life. This is my agna to you for as long as you live."
58.8 With great respect for these words of Shreeji Maharaj, Muktanand Swami promised to devoutly abide by them. Then, folding his hands, he bowed before Shreeji Maharaj.

Bhagvan And Sant Are Kalyan-Kari
59.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Shravan sud 12 [6th August 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
59.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "In the four Veds, the Purans, and the historical shastras, there is one central principle, and that is that only Bhagvan and His sant can grant kalyan. In fact, Bhagvan's sant is greater that even Shiv, Brahma, and the other devs. So, when a person attains Bhagvan or His sant, apart from this, there is no other kalyan for that jeev; this itself is ultimate kalyan.
59.3 "Furthermore, only those who have accumulated a great number of rewards from performing good deeds receive the opportunity to serve Bhagvan's sant, but those who have few merits do not. So, a person should develop love for Bhagvan's sant just as he has love for his wife, son, parents, or brother. Then, due to this love, the jeev becomes absolutely fulfilled.
59.4 "Moreover, even if a person's wife, son, or other family members are unworthy; and even if they are dishonest and evil, in no way would he perceive avgun in them. Conversely, even if the bhakta of Bhagvan possesses every noble quality, if he were to utter even a few harsh words, then a person would hold a grudge against him for as long as he lives. If a person has such an attitude, then in no way can he be said to have as much love for the bhaktas of Bhagvan as he does for his relatives. As a result, he would not attain kalyan.
59.5 "Furthermore, the greatness of the sant is as much as I mentioned earlier. Yet, even after attaining Bhagvan and His sant, some people still have the doubt, 'Will I attain kalyan or not?' What can be the reason for this? Well, in his past lives, that person had not attained Bhagvan or His sant, and nor had he served them. Therefore, this is a new experience for him, which will show rewards in his subsequent lives. On the other hand, if a person had attained Bhagvan and His sant and had served them in his past lives, then in this life, his love for the bhaktas of Bhagvan would never diminish; nor would he waver in his nishchay. Even if his disturbing thoughts related to kam, krodh, or lobh persisted, his nishchay in Bhagvan would not dissolve. Then, what can be said about his nishchay not faltering due to some other person's influence? In fact, even if his own mind were to try to sway him from his nishchay, he would still not be swayed. Such a person's determination can be said to be like that of Nath Bhakta, Vishnudas, Himraj Shah and Bhalchandra Sheth; and Kashidas and Damodar also had this determination. When a person possesses such determination, it should be known that this person has been a bhakta of Bhagvan in a past life."

Overcoming Difficulties When Performing The Bhakti Of Bhagvan
60.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Shravan vad 4 [13th August 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in the eastern veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had tied a white pagh around His head. He had also covered Himself with a thin, white cloth. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
60.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj requested, "Please begin a question-answer discussion."
60.3 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, life is full of difficulties. Amidst all these difficulties, what understanding should a bhakta of Bhagvan develop in order to remain happy at heart?"
60.4 Shreeji Maharaj began, "To answer that, I shall tell you about my own experience." He then explained, "By keeping the following three forms of awareness, I am not obstructed by any disturbances: constant awareness of the atma, which is distinct from the body; the awareness of the perishable nature of all worldly objects; and the awareness of Bhagvan's greatness. By keeping these three forms of awareness, no difficulties obstruct me in any way.
60.5 "However, if a person does encounter some difficulties, then due to the nature of the chitt, it may appear that there is some disturbance. However, the effect of that disturbance does not penetrate into the chaitanya. This can be realised by the fact that a person never experiences disturbances that are occurring externally when he is dreaming. On the other hand, if a disturbance has penetrated into the chaitanya, it is experienced in all three mental states ( jagrat, svapna, and sushupti). Therefore, because I do not experience any disturbances in my dreams, it can be assumed that no disturbances have affected my chaitanya in any way.
60.6 "Having said this, if a bhakta of Bhagvan encounters some sort of distressing hardship, it is not as if I do not realise it; I very much do feel it in my heart. Only a vimukh like Raghunath-Das would not feel it. When Ramanand Swami left his body, all the satsangis began to cry, but Raghunath-Das was not at all upset. Instead, he wandered around, laughing and talking to others. Therefore, only an outcast or a vimukh would not feel hurt when a bhakta of Bhagvan encounters some sort of misery; but a bhakta of Bhagvan would definitely become distressed by the suffering of other bhaktas."
60.7 Continuing, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The shastras state that if a bhakta of Bhagvan is being killed or harassed by someone, then a person who stands in defence of that bhakta of Bhagvan – and in doing so dies or becomes wounded himself – is totally freed from the five great sins. Such is the glory of defending a bhakta of Bhagvan. However, if a person is hurt by the words of the bhaktas of Bhagvan – as if he has been shot in the heart by some arrows – and if a grudge develops from that hatred to such an extent that it is not resolved as long as he lives, then such a person is like an outcast. Even if such a person possesses qualities such as dharma and tyag, or performs tap, it is all worthless. In fact, even if he performs a million other activities, his jeev will not attain kalyan.
60.8 "In society, if a woman has equal love for her husband as she does for another man, then she is looked upon as being immoral – like a prostitute. Similarly, if a person in this world believes, 'As far as I am concerned, all sadhus are equal. Who is good and who is bad?', then even if he is considered to be a satsangi, he should be known to be a vimukh. In addition, in case a person feels, 'If I say something inappropriate, my own friends will criticise me,' he listens as someone speaks unkindly of a bhakta of Bhagvan in order to preserve his respect. He should also be known to be a vimukh, even though he may be considered to be a satsangi.
60.9 "Therefore, a person should be absolutely loyal to a bhakta of Bhagvan – just as he is loyal to his relatives and his mother and father. If ever some sort of difficulty does happen to arise with a bhakta of Bhagvan, only a person who does not develop a grudge, but settles the difference and reunites with that bhakta – like a line drawn in water – can be called a true bhakta of Bhagvan."
60.10 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj finally added, "I am very compassionate – like Dattatrey, Jadbharat, Narad, and Shukji. In fact, once while I was travelling in the east, I came across a group of tyagis. They ordered me: 'Go and pick some green spinach'. I replied, 'I will not pick it, because it too contains a jeev'. Hearing this, one of them drew a sword and threatened me. Nevertheless, I did not pick the spinach. This is the extent of my compassionate nature. However, if a person looks angrily at a bhakta of Bhagvan, then even if that person is a relative of mine, I feel like tearing his eyes out; and if he should hurt a bhakta of Bhagvan with his hands, I feel like cutting his hands off. Such is the hatred I experience; and in those cases, I do not show any compassion. Only a person who has such loyalty for a bhakta of Bhagvan can be called a complete bhakta of Bhagvan."

Gadhada II – 61
Niyams, Nishchay In Bhagvan, And Loyalty 
61.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Shravan vad 7 [17th August 1825], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead in the eastern veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He had tied a golden-bordered, white shelu around His head and had covered Himself with another white shelu. He was also wearing a white khes and a garland of mogra flowers. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
61.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A person who possesses three characteristics can be called a firm satsangi. What are these three characteristics? The first is to strictly follow the niyams prescribed by his ishta-dev – to such an extent that he would never abandon those niyams even at the cost of his life. The second is to have extremely firm nishchay in Bhagvan, so much so that he would never diverge from it even if others or his own mind was to raise doubts. The third is to be loyal to those Vaishnav bhaktas who worship their ishta-dev – just as parents are loyal to their children, a son is loyal to his father, and a wife is loyal to her husband. A person who possesses these three characteristics completely can be called a firm satsangi."
61.3 Then continuing, Shreeji Maharaj said, "When someone comes and sits at the front of a sabha of bhaktas, others think, 'This person must be a great satsangi'. However, the test of a great satsangi is as follows: If he is a grahastha, he would surrender everything he has for Bhagvan and His bhaktas; and if required to do so, he would even give his life for satsang; and the moment his ishta-dev gives an agna for h im to become a paramhans, he would immediately become a paramhans. If a bhakta of Bhagvan possesses these characteristics, then whether he sits at the front of a sabha of bhaktas, or at the back, he should be considered to be great amongst all bhaktas. Moreover, a tyagi who remains unaffected and continues to firmly follow all of his niyams, despite encountering wealth and women in his travels to other regions, is considered to be great amongst all tyagis.
61.4 "If a person with rajo- gun, who is considered to be reputable in society, comes to a sabha, then he should be respected accordingly and given a seat at the very front of the sabha. Such etiquette should be observed by those possessing gnan, as well as by tyagis. If they do not, then the consequences can be harmful. Consider the example of when Parikshit Raja went to the rushi's ashram. The rushi happened to be in samadhi and so the king was not honoured. As a result, the king became angry and threw a dead snake around the rushi's neck. Then, the rushi's son cursed the king, leading to the king's death seven days later.
61.5 "There is also the example of when Daksh prajapati visited Brahma's sabha. There, Shivji neither stood up for Daksh, nor welcomed him verbally; therefore upsetting Daksh. He then cancelled Shivji's share in the yagna he performed. Then, Nandishvar and Bhrugu Rushi cursed each other; because of that sin, Sati burnt to death in Daksh's sacrifice. This prompted Virbhadra to cut off Daksh's head and offer it in the fire, which resulted in Daksh receiving the head of a goat.
61.6 "Therefore, all of you grahasthas and tyagis should abide by the following: Those who are considered to be respectable in society and worldly affairs should in no way be insulted in a sabha. If they are dishonoured, it will definitely lead to problems and create obstructions in worship. For this reason, all satsangi grahasthas and tyagis should firmly abide by this principle of mine."

Gadhada II – 62
atma- Nishtha, Pati- Vrata, And Seva
62.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Magshar sud 2 [22nd November 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had tied a white pagh around His head. Also, He had covered Himself with a white chofal. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
62.2 Shreeji Maharaj then summoned His nephews, Ayodhyaprasadji and Raghuvirji, and said to them, "You may ask me questions."
62.3 Then, Ayodhyaprasadji first asked, "In life, a man may be engrossed in the entanglements of worldly affairs all day long, and during that time, he may well perform some moral as well as immoral karmas. Moreover, he may engage in worship for only half an hour or so. Is this enough to burn all of the sins he has committed during the day, or not? That is my question?"
62.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Even if a person has spent the whole day in pravrutti, and regardless of whatever type of activities he may have been involved in, when he engages in the worship of Bhagvan, if his indriyas, antah-karans, and jeev all unite and become engrossed in worship, then even if he does so for half an hour, or even for a few minutes, all of his sins will be burnt to ashes. However, if his indriyas, antah-karans, and jeev do not unite and engage in worship, then his sins cannot be burned by worshipping for such a short while. Such a person can attain kalyan only by the grace of Bhagvan. This is the answer to your question."
62.5 Next, Raghuvirji asked a question, "Maharaj, what must a person do for the moksh of the jeev?"
62.6 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "If a person seeks kalyan, he should place his body, wealth, home, family, and relations in the seva of Bhagvan. Furthermore, he should avoid any object that may not be of use in the seva of Bhagvan. A person who lives a life centred around Bhagvan joins the ranks of Narad and the Sanakadik in the dham of Bhagvan and attains ultimate moksh after he dies, even if he is a grahastha. This is the answer to your question."
62.7 Having answered their questions, Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Since the day I began thinking about it, I have noticed that there are three strengths which lead to kalyan and which lead to extreme bliss. Of these, the first is the strength of intense atma- nishtha, which is to believe a person's true self to be the atma and engage in worship of Bhagvan, like Shukji. The second is like the strength of pati- vrata, which is to worship Bhagvan as if He is his husband, just as the gopis did. The third is the strength of seva, which is to worship Bhagvan as His das, just like Hanumanji and Uddhavji. Without these three strengths, there is no way in which the jeev can attain kalyan. In fact, I, myself have firmly developed all three of these strengths. Even if a person possesses one of these strengths firmly, he becomes absolutely fulfilled.
62.8 "I shall now describe the characteristics of these three strengths individually. Firstly, the following are the characteristics of a person who has realised the atma. On one side there is the atma and on the other side is the crowd of Maya – the body, the indriyas, the antah-karans, the three gun, and the panch-vishays. The thought that rests between the two is full of gnan. This thought remains steady, just as the tip of a flame remains steady in the absence of wind. It is this thought which prevents the body, indriyas, and antah-karans from becoming one with the atma. In fact, even the thought itself does not become one with the atma.
62.9 "When the jeev attains this thought, its vruttis, which once reached all the way to Kashi, recede to reach only as far as Vadtal. When that thought is strengthened, the vruttis then recede from Vadtal to reach only as far as Gadhada. Then, from reaching as far as Gadhada, they recede and come into the vicinity of the body. From the body, the vruttis recede further and rest in the organs of the indriyas. From the organs of the indriyas, the vruttis of the indriyas turn inward towards the antah-karans. Finally, the vruttis of the indriyas and antah-karans become absorbed in the atma. It is then that the jeev's karan body, which is full of worldly desires, is said to be destroyed.
62.10 "Furthermore, when this thought meets with the atma, divine light is generated in the heart of the thinker, and he understands himself as being brahm-rup. In addition, he also has the realisation of Parbrahm Narayan, who resides within that brahm. A person who has this realisation feels, 'I am the atma, and Paramatma eternally resides within me'. Such a sustained state is the highest level of atma-nishtha.
62.11 "Secondly, the strength of a person with pati-vrata should be like that of the gopis of Vraj. For example, from the day the gopis touched the holy feet of Shree Krishna Bhagvan, all the pleasures of this world became like poison to them. In this way, if a pati- vrata wife sees a man who is as handsome as Indra, or who is like a dev or some king, then she would withdraw her eyes, just as when a person sees a rotting dog or some faeces and becomes extremely disgusted and looks away. This is the highest level of pati- vrata. Therefore, if a person attaches his vruttis to Bhagvan just as a pati- vrata wife does with her husband, his mind would never become pleased upon seeing anyone else.
62.12 "Thirdly, a person who has a strength of offering bhakti with seva would like the darshan only of his ishta-dev; he would like to hear talks only about Him; he would like His ishtadev's nature; and he would also prefer to stay only with Him. However, even though he has such love, for the sake of serving his ishta-dev and earning His pleasure, he wishes day and night, 'If my ishta-dev were to command me, I would follow that command most happily'. If his ishta-dev was to give a command that would force him to stay far away, he would stay there happily, but in no way would he be disheartened. In fact, he finds supreme bliss in following the command itself. This is the highest level of seva. Today, Gopalanand Swami and also Muktanand Swami have the strength of offering bhakti with seva.
62.13 "Among the bhaktas of Bhagvan who possess one of these three strengths, there are three levels – uttam, madhyam, and kanishth. Those who are not found in any one of these categories can only be called wretched. Therefore, it is only proper to die after a person has thoroughly developed one of the three strengths; it is not appropriate to die if a person has not completely developed any single one of the three. Instead, it would be better if a person lives five days longer to dispel his misunderstandings and strengthen at least one of these three inclinations, and then die."
62.14 Continuing, Shreeji Maharaj added, "The nature of the jeev is such that when a person is a grahastha, he would prefer to abandon worldly life; but once he has abandoned the world, he has desires for the pleasures of worldly life once again. This is the rebellious nature of the jeev. Therefore, a person who is a firm bhakta of Bhagvan should worship Bhagvan after discarding such a rebellious nature as well as all of his personal likes and dislikes. Moreover, it is only appropriate to die after eradicating all desires other than those of Bhagvan.
62.15 "However, if a person does not have intense love for Bhagvan, he should strengthen only atma- nishtha by thought. This is because a bhakta of Bhagvan should either possess firm atma- nishtha or extremely deep love for Bhagvan. If a person is not firm in either one of these two strengths, he should strictly abide by the niyams of this satsang. Only then will he be able to remain a satsangi; otherwise he will fall from satsang.
62.16 "When a bhakta of Bhagvan experiences difficulties of any kind, it should be known that the source of those miseries is not Kal, karma, or Maya. In actual fact, it is Bhagvan Himself who inspires difficulties to fall upon His bhaktas in order to test their patience. Then, just as a man hides behind a curtain and watches, Bhagvan hides in the heart of His bhakta and from there He observes the bhakta's patience. Also who are Kal, karma, and Maya that they could harm a bhakta of Bhagvan? So, realising it to be Bhagvan's wish, a bhakta of Bhagvan should remain cheerful."
62.17 Upon hearing this, Muktanand Swami asked a question: "Maharaj, the talk in which you have just described the three strengths is very subtle and difficult to put into practice. Only a few can understand it and only a few can actually live by it; not everyone can do so. However, there are hundreds of thousands of people in satsang, and it would be difficult for all of them to understand this principle. So, how can they progress?"
62.18 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "If a person behaves as a das of the das of a bhakta who possesses one of these three strengths, and if he also follows his agna, then despite not understanding anything else, he would certainly become a parshad of Bhagvan after this very life, and would therefore become fulfilled.
62.19 "In this world, the glory of Bhagvan and His bhaktas is indeed very great. After all, no matter how sinful or insignificant a person may be, if he seeks the refuge of Bhagvan and His bhaktas, that person will become absolutely fulfilled. Such is the greatness of Bhagvan and His bhaktas. Therefore, a person who has received the opportunity to serve the bhaktas of Bhagvan's should remain fearless."
62.20 Finally, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I have delivered this talk about the three strengths mainly for the sake of Muktanand Swami because I have a great deal of love for him. So, bearing in mind that Muktanand Swami is suffering from an illness, I spoke today to be sure that no form of deficiency remains in his understanding."
62.21 In reply, Muktanand Swami said, "Maharaj, I also felt that you delivered this talk for me."

Gadhada II – 63
Gaining Strength After Performing Seva
63.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Magshar vad 2 [8th December 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in His place of residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Bhajananand Swami was reading the Shreemad Bhagvat before Shreeji Maharaj, and a sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had also gathered before Him.
63.2 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "The thought which rests between the drashta and the drashya keeps the drashta and drashya separated. In this, what should be understood as the consciousness of the jeev and what should be understood as the consciousness of the antah- karans?"
63.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "It seems to me that if a person's jeev has become extremely powerful, then the vruttis of his antah-karans are in the vruttis of his jeev. These vruttis seem to be divided into four categories, according to the four respective functions of the antah- karans. Therefore, the awareness in the indriyas and antah-karans is that of the jeev itself. Therefore, the jeev allows the indriyas and antah-karans to apply themselves wherever it is appropriate to do so and restricts them from doing as they please where it is inappropriate to do so. In fact, if a person's jeev has become very powerful, he would not even have impure dreams. On the other hand, if a person's jeev is lacking in strength, then he should follow the principle of Sankhya and behave only as the atma ( drashta); but, a person should not associate with his indriyas and antah-karans. By behaving as the atma in this way, his jeev gains great strength.
63.4 "However, there is an even greater method than this to gain strength. If a person has love for Bhagvan and His sant, possesses intense shraddha in serving them, and also engages in the nine types of bhakti, then his jeev will instantly gain strength. Therefore, for making the jeev stronger, there is no method comparable to that of serving Bhagvan and His bhaktas.
63.5 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "I shall now tell you a personal principle of mine. When I became ill in the year of Samvat 1869, I saw Kailas and Vaikunth, and I also saw myself riding on Nandishvar and riding on Garud. However, I did not find any pleasure in those powers. Then, I began to behave only as the atma, at which point all disturbances decreased. However, then I thought, 'Much better than behaving as the atma is to stay within the company of Bhagvan and His bhaktas'. I then become afraid, 'What if by behaving as the atma, I cannot return to this body again?' Therefore, to stay within the company of Bhagvan and His bhaktas and to be able to serve them in whichever way possible, is indeed the very best spiritual activity."
63.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj explained, "Countless types of mental and physical suffering arise during the final moments of a person's life. But, when a person has the darshan of Bhagvan and His s ant, all those miseries are expelled. This is the greatness of Bhagvan and His bhaktas. In actual fact, the bhaktas of Bhagvan are indeed nothing but a murti of brahm. That is why a person should never perceive human traits in them.
63.7 "In addition, with the bhaktas of Bhagvan a person should behave in the same way as family members do amongst themselves. For example, even if a person lectures his own family members out of love, or if they happen to lecture him, grudges still do not develop in their hearts. With bhaktas of Bhagvan, a person should behave in the same way. On the other hand, if a person does develop a grudge with Bhagvan or His bhaktas, I do not even like to look at him. In fact, my anger with such a person never subsides. Moreover, those in this world who commit the five great sins can still be redeemed someday, whereas a person who spites bhaktas of Bhagvan can never be redeemed.
63.8 "Therefore, there is no reward greater than that of serving bhaktas of Bhagvan, and there is no sin greater than that of spiting bhaktas of Bhagvan. Therefore, if a person wishes to make his jeev powerful, then he should sincerely serve Bhagvan and His bhaktas by thought, word, and deed."

Gadhada II – 64
Purushottam Bhagvan Is The Cause Of All Avatars
64.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Posh sud 7 [27th December 1824], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
64.2 Then, Svayamprakashanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, are all avatars of Bhagvan equal, or are there distinctions among them?"
64.3 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "After listening to and analytically thinking about all the shastras written by Vyasji, the conclusion I have reached regarding the avatars of Bhagvan, such as Matsya, Kurma, Varah, and Nrusinh, is that Shree Krishna Bhagvan is the source of them all. That is to say, Shree Krishna Bhagvan is not an avatar like the other avatars, but is Himself the source of all avatars. That very Shree Krishna Bhagvan is our ishta-dev. His divya charitras are narrated in the tenth skandh of the Shreemad Bhagvat Puran. I have also considered it as a great authority in our Uddhav Sampraday.
64.4 "As all other avatars are also of Shree Krishna Bhagvan, we should respect those avatars and all shastras which describe those avatars. Nevertheless, we should primarily respect only Shree Krishna Bhagvan and the shastras which describe Him."
64.5 Then, Purushottam Bhatt asked a question, "Bhagvan created this world for the kalyan of the jeevs. But, would it not have been possible for Bhagvan, without creating this world, to grant kalyan to the jeevs while they were dormant in the womb of Maya? Instead, why does He take the trouble of creating this whole world? That is the question."
64.6 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Bhagvan Shree Krishna Purushottam is the supreme ruler and is eternal. He is forever present on His sinhasan in His Akshardham. Countless millions of brahmands reside within the refuge of that Akshardham. For example, a king who rules over the whole world owns innumerable villages; and of those, if one or two were to become deserted, or if one or two became populated, he would not even take notice. Similarly, Shree Krishna Bhagvan is the lord of countless millions of brahmands. However, the brahmands are not destroyed all at once. Therefore, if one or two brahmands are destroyed, Bhagvan would not even take note of it.
64.7 "In addition, the birth of that Shree Krishna Bhagvan from Devki is only for the sake of narration, because in actual fact, He is forever beyond birth.
64.8 "Furthermore, the Akshardham of Shree Krishna Bhagvan is beyond Prakruti and Purush by its vyatirek nature, and it pervades everywhere by its anvay nature – just as akash is present everywhere by its anvay nature, and is beyond the four bhuts by its vyatirek nature. This is Shree Krishna Bhagvan's Akshardham.
64.9 "Moreover, Shree Krishna Bhagvan forever dwells within that dham. However, despite being present in Akshardham, He also grants darshan to whomever, wherever, and in whichever way it is necessary. He speaks to whomever it is necessary to speak to, and even touches whomever it is necessary to touch. Just as a person who has attained siddh-dasha can see for thousands of miles while remaining in one place, and hear talks from thousands of miles away, similarly, despite being in His Akshardham, Bhagvan also reveals Himself in the countless millions of brahmands wherever there is a need to be revealed. Nevertheless, He Himself is still always present in His Akshardham. The fact that He remains in one place and yet reveals himself in countless places is a demonstration of his extraordinary powers – just as during the ras- leela, when He assumed as many svarups as there were gopis. This use of Bhagvan's extraordinary powers to remain in one place and at the same time to appear in countless places is itself His pervasive svarup. However, unlike akash, he does not pervade without possessing a svarup.
64.10 "Moreover, by the extraordinary powers of Bhagvan, the five hundred million yojan surface of the pruthvi becomes the size of a sub-atomic particle at the time of destruction. Then, at the time of creation, from being sub-atomic in size, the pruthvi again becomes five hundred million yojans large. Also, thunder, lightning, and dense clouds of rain appear in the monsoon season. These and all other such wonders are all due to the extraordinary powers of Bhagvan.
64.11 "That Shree Krishna Bhagvan is worthy to be worshipped by a mumukshu in every way. While the other avatars possessed the greatness of maybe one or two powers, Shree Krishna Bhagvan possesses all powers. After all, Shree Krishna Bhagvan is not only rasik, He is also a tyagi; He possesses gnan and is also the sovereign ruler; He is a coward as well as brave; He is extremely compassionate and is a master of all extraordinary powers; and He is very strong as well as very deceptive. In this respect, only Shree Krishna Bhagvan possesses all powers.
64.12 "It is in Shree Krishna Bhagvan's Akshardham that the countless millions of brahmands are supported forever. Of those, when the hundred year lifespan (the lifespan of Brahma) of a particular brahmand ends, that brahmand is destroyed. From this, it is clear that not all brahmands are destroyed as the same time. So, if other brahmands are still present at the time of destruction, why should Bhagvan grant kalyan to the jeevs at that time? This is the answer to the question."
64.13 In this way, Shreeji Maharaj indirectly revealed Himself as Purushottam. Upon hearing this, all the bhaktas realised that the same Shree Krishna Purushottam is in actual fact Shreeji Maharaj, the son of Dharma and Bhakti.

The Darshan Of The Murti Of Bhagvan - The Over-Wise
65.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Posh sud 11 [1st January 1825], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead near the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
65.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please listen, as I wish to speak about Bhagvan."
65.3 The sadhus, who were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a pakhvaj, stopped singing. They then folded their hands and settled down to listen.
65.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj began, "When Bhagvan takes birth on earth for the kalyan of the jeevs as an avatar, such as Ram and Krishna, He is not infatuated by anything in this world, which is the result of Maya. In fact, due to His alokik majesty, He behaves absolutely fearlessly. However, for the sake of accepting the bhakti of His bhaktas, He also thoroughly indulges in the panch-vishays. Seeing this, those people in the world who are over-wise, perceive faults in Bhagvan. They think, 'He may be called Bhagvan, but He has more attachment to this world than we do'. Thinking this, they consider Bhagvan to be human, just like themselves, but they do not realise His alokik greatness. This in itself is Bhagvan's Maya.
65.5 "In fact, even a sadhu who has realised the atma and has become brahm-rup is not infatuated upon seeing any object of this world. So, what is surprising about Shree Krishna Bhagvan – who is Parbrahm, and who is greater than Brahm – being able to remain uninfluenced by Maya and the result of Maya? He certainly can."
65.6 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A sadhu who has attained atma- nishtha also possesses intense vairagya. Due to both of these qualities, he will not become attached to anything in any way. However, if he does not possess bhakti towards Bhagvan, it is as good as preparing many different types of food dishes but not adding salt; all would be tasteless. In the same way, without the bhakti of Bhagvan, atma- nishtha and vairagya alone are simply useless; a person can never attain kalyan through them.
65.7 "Realising this, Shukji studied the Shreemad Bhagvat and offered great bhakti to Shree Krishna Bhagvan, despite having already become brahm-svarup. Therefore, it is a great deficiency of a person who has atma- nishtha to not have bhakti towards Bhagvan.
65.8 "In the same way, if a person has bhakti towards Bhagvan, but does not have atma- nishtha and vairagya, then just as a person has love towards Bhagvan, he will also develop love towards other things. Therefore, this is a major deficiency for those following the path of bhakti.
65.9 "Now, a perfect bhakta of Bhagvan has thoroughly realised Bhagvan's greatness; so, everything except Bhagvan seems worthless to him. That is why he is not infatuated by anything. Therefore, when a person possesses all three qualities of atma- nishtha, vairagya, and bhakti towards Bhagvan, he can be said to have no deficiencies whatsoever. Such a person is called a bhakta with gnan, an ekantik bhakta, and a loyal bhakta of Bhagvan."

Gadhada II – 66
A Person Cannot Recognise His Own Avgun - A Red-Hot Iron Ball
66.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Posh vad 1 [5th January 1825], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Garlands of yellow flowers and red guldavadi flowers were hanging around His neck, and a tassel of yellow flowers decorated His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him in a sabha. Some of the sadhus were singing a vishnupad to the accompaniment of a saroda and dukad.
66.2 After the kirtans had finished, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Today, I wish to ask all the senior sadhus some questions." Having said this, He directed His first question to anandanand Swami. He said, "Suppose there is a person who recognises his own faults and does not look at the avgun of other bhaktas, despite having little intelligence; instead, he looks only at their gun. On the other hand, suppose there is another person who is very intelligent, but he does not see his own avgun. Moreover, he overlooks the gun of other bhaktas and looks only at their avgun. Why is it that the person with little intelligence finds avgun in himself, whereas the person with much intelligence cannot realise his own avgun? That is the question."
66.3 anand Swami answered to the bet of his ability, but he was unable to give a satisfactory reply.
66.4 So, Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The answer to that is as follows: It is because that person has offended some great bhakta of Bhagvan either in this life or in a past life. As a result of that sin, his intellect has become corrupted. That is why he perceives avgun in bhaktas without being able to realise avgun in himself. This is the only answer to that question."
66.5 Next, Shreeji Maharaj asked Nityanand Swami a question, "Is there only one method to attain Bhagvan, or are there many? You may say that Bhagvan can be attained by four methods – gnan, vairagya, bhakti, and dharma. However, if Bhagvan is attained by these four methods, then the principle that kalyan can be attained exclusively by seeking the refuge Bhagvan is invalid."
66.6 Nityanand Swami tried to answer the question in many different ways, but was unable to do so satisfactorily.
66.7 So, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Kalyan is only attained by the refuge of Bhagvan. However, Bhagvan is very powerful; even the devs live under His agna. In fact, out of fear of Bhagvan, even the causes of all the brahmands, such as Kal and Maya, faithfully follow His agna. Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvan should also strictly follow Bhagvan's agna; that is the very characteristic of a bhakta of Bhagvan. For this reason, all other spiritual activities should also be performed strictly. Therefore, kalyan is possible only through Bhagvan, whereas those spiritual activities are for the purpose of pleasing Bhagvan. That is the only answer to the question."
66.8 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked Brahmanand Swami, "Is the jeev that dwells within the body, sakar, or is it nirakar?"
66.9 Brahmanand Swami replied, "It possesses a svarup."
66.10 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If the jeev did possess a svarup, then that would mean it has hands, feet, and other limbs. However, a shlok in the tenth skandh of the Shreemad Bhagvat states, 'Bhagvan created the buddhi, indriyas, man, and prans to enable the jeev to attain kalyan'. If the jeev itself did possess a svarup, then what would be the need of creating the buddhi, indriyas, man, and prans for it? Therefore, after seeing such words in the shastras, a person can only conclude that the jeev is sachidanand.
66.11 "That jeev also possesses the karan body, which is the embodiment of eternal ignorance. Just as a magnetic rock attracts iron and then sticks to the iron, similarly, the jeev has a nature of sticking. Therefore, the jeev sticks to the two mayik bodies – the sthul body and the sukshma body. Then, due to its ignorance, the jeev believes those bodies to be its own. In reality, the jeev is not at all like those bodies."
66.12 Then, Brahmanand Swami asked, "After the ignorance of the jeev is removed by the bhakti of Bhagvan, the association between the jeev and the three mayik bodies ( sthul, sukshma, and karan) no longer remains. So, when the jeev attains the dham of Bhagvan, with what type of svarup does it stay there?"
66.13 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "When the jeev's ignorance is dispelled, its association with the three mayik bodies is broken. Then, the jeev remains pure and composed of chaitanya. Then, by Bhagvan's will, the jeev receives a body composed of chaitanya prakruti – which is distinct from the eight types of jad prakruti of Bhagvan. Then, with that body, the jeev stays in Bhagvan's Akshardham. This is the answer to your question."
66.14 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked Gopalanand Swami a question; "It is due to the grace of Bhagvan and His sant that a person can master ashtang- yog or see the atma. Then, why is it that even though Bhagvan and His sant are the cause of these, they become secondary; and instead, a person's interest in yog and atma- nishtha increases?"
66.15 Gopalanand Swami replied, "After practicing ashtang- yog, when a person actually masters it, he develops a little pride. As a result, he becomes somewhat less interested in Bhagvan."
66.16 To this, Shreeji Maharaj commented, "When a yogi attains siddh-dasha, he also becomes brahm- rup, and no form of pride is possible in brahm. Therefore, your answer is not correct."
66.17 Gopalanand Swami then said, "Maharaj, I cannot understand this. Please be compassionate and explain it to me."
66.18 So, Shreeji Maharaj said, "It should be understood in the following way: When a person wishes to eradicate his faults, he should eradicate them after seeking advice of a great sant. For example, if a person has some worldly task to perform, and he wants to accomplish that job extremely well, he should seek the advice of some experts. Similarly, such advice is also necessary for eradicating faults. For example, even though Shukji had become brahm-svarup, he studied the Shreemad Bhagvat with great enthusiasm. In fact, even to this very day, he engages in the bhakti of Bhagvan. Also, the eighty-eight thousand rushis, including Shaunak, had become brahm-svarup; but, they too listened to the kathas related to Bhagvan from Sutpurani. Therefore, a person should take guidance from such words to strengthen his bhakti.
66.19 "For the faults that a person cannot recognise, he should pray to Bhagvan: 'Maharaj, please be compassionate and destroy whichever faults I may have' – just as when a man has been accused of something and has no witnesses to disprove the allegation, he proves his innocence by holding a red-hot iron ball. Similarly, if a fault cannot be realised, he should pray to Bhagvan for the eradication of that fault, which amounts to holding the iron ball. A person should eradicate his faults in this way. That is the answer to your question."
66.20 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked Muktanand Swami a question: "Suppose a bhakta of Bhagvan has thoroughly realised Bhagvan, but Bhagvan does not show him any miracles. Now, if some other performer of magical spells does show him a miracle, then upon seeing this, would the mind of that bhakta sway from Bhagvan, or not?"
66.21 Muktanand Swami replied, "Maharaj, if a person has absolute nishchay in Bhagvan, then he would never have nishchay in anyone but Bhagvan. On the other hand, if a person does have nishchay in someone else, then he does not have nishchay in Bhagvan at all. Such a person is merely a false bhakta; he cannot be called a true bhakta of Bhagvan."
66.22 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj agreed, "That is the exact answer to the question."
66.23 Finally, Shreeji Maharaj asked Shuk Muni, "If a bhakta of Bhagvan has attained the understanding of Bhagvan and His sant, then how does he benefit while he is alive, and how does he benefit after he dies?"
66.24 Shuk Muni said, "Maharaj, that question can be answered only by you."
66.25 So, Shreeji Maharaj said, "While alive, a person who has attained Bhagvan and His sant spends his days and nights engrossed in kathas and kirtans related to Bhagvan. He also has the direct realisation of his jeevatma, which is beyond the three mental states, as being brahm-rup. With the exception of Bhagvan, he develops vairagya for all other objects. Also, he discards adharma and abides by dharma.
66.26 "When that bhakta dies, Bhagvan makes him just like Himself. In fact, Bhagvan had blessed Brahma: 'O Brahma! By my grace, may you know me as I am, my glory as it is, and my qualities and actions as they are'. So, just as Bhagvan has blessed Brahma, He also grants the same blessings to all of His faithful bhaktas. In addition, just as Bhagvan is free from Kal, karma, and Maya, in the same way, these bhaktas of Bhagvan also becomes free from Kal, karma, and Maya. Also, he forever resides in the seva of Bhagvan. This is how that bhakta benefits after he abandons his body. That is the answer to the question."

Gadhada II – 67
The Gangajaliyo Well - Becoming Like Bhagvan
67.1 In the Samvat year 1881, on Maha vad 3 [6th February 1825], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a large, cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on the platform near the Gangajaliyo well adjacent to His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him in a sabha. Some of the sadhus were singing a vishnupad to the accompaniment of a saroda and dukad.
67.2 After thinking about the kirtans, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I wish to ask all the sadhus the following question: A bhakta of Bhagvan leaves his body, becomes brahm-rup, and attains the dham of Bhagvan. Then, what is the difference between that bhakta and Bhagvan, whereby the master-servant relationship between them still remains? After all, that bhakta of Bhagvan then becomes independent, just like Bhagvan. He also becomes free from the restraints of Kal, karma, and Maya – just like Bhagvan. Therefore, what difference remains so that the master-servant relationship is maintained? This is my question."
67.3 The paramhans answered according to their understanding, but they could not give a precise answer to Shreeji Maharaj's question. So, all the sadhus said, "Maharaj, your question will only be answered when you yourself answer it."
67.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The answer is as follows: In whatever way a bhakta of Bhagvan has understood Bhagvan – 'Bhagvan possesses this many powers; He possesses this much charm; He is the embodiment of bliss' – that is the extent to which he has understood the greatness of Bhagvan. Then, when that bhakta leaves his body and goes to the dham of Bhagvan, he attains charm and powers based on the extent to which he has realised the majesty of Bhagvan. Despite this, that bhakta still feels Bhagvan's majesty (His powers and charm) to be much greater. He then realises, 'Bhagvan has granted me just as many divya powers and as much charm as I had realised in Him. Yet, Bhagvan's divya powers and charm appear to be totally limitless. Like me, countless others have also attained qualities similar to that of Bhagvan, but no one is capable of becoming like Bhagvan'.
67.5 "This is because not even Shesh, Sharada, Brahma, the other devs, or the four Veds can understand the vastness of Bhagvan's greatness, His qualities, His actions, His birth, His power, His charm, His blissful nature, or His countless other kalyan- kari. In fact, Bhagvan Himself cannot understand the limits of His own greatness. Therefore, Bhagvan, with all of His powers, is beyond all limits.
67.6 "By worshipping that Bhagvan, countless millions of Vaishnavs have become like Bhagvan. However, Bhagvan's majesty has not diminished even slightly. For example, even if there were an ocean filled with sweet water from which all humans, animals, and birds could drink as much as they wished, and from which vessels could be filled, the water would still not decrease because of the vastness of the ocean. Similarly, Bhagvan's greatness is infinite; there is no way in which it can either increase or decrease. For this reason, those bhaktas of Bhagvan who become brahm-svarup, still behave as Bhagvan's servants and engage in His worship. In this way, bhaktas of Bhagvan attain qualities similar to those of Bhagvan; but, the master-servant relationship between them is maintained. That is the answer to the question."


Shree Vadtal Prakaran

Vadtal – 1
Nirvikalp Samadhi
1.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Kartik sud 11 [21st November 1825], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a cushion with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a sinhasan in the mango grove along the banks of Lake Gomti on the north side of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was wearing a white surval and a white angarkhu. He had also tied a blue reto around His waist. An orange reto with edges decorated with golden threads was tied around His head, and another orange reto with a brocaded border was resting upon His shoulder. In addition to this, a garland of roses was hanging around His neck, tassels of roses had been placed upon His head, and bajubandh and gajara had been tied around His arms. Shreeji Maharaj sat in a charming way facing north, while a sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, gathered before Him.
1.2 Shobha-Ram Shastri of Vadodara asked Shreeji Maharaj a question: "Maharaj, when a mumukshu attains nirvikalp samadhi, he becomes gunatit and an ekantik bhakta of Bhagvan. Then, what becomes of a person who does not attain nirvikalp samadhi?"
1.3 Then, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Nirvikalp samadhi is not only attained when the prans are controlled. There is another way to attain nirvikalp samadhi, which I shall explain to you; so, please listen carefully.
1.4 "The Shreemad Bhagvat states: atra sargo visargash-cha sthanam poshanam-utayaha manvanta-reshanu-katha nirodho muktir-ashrayaha : The ten characteristics of topics of discussion by which Bhagvan can be realised: sarg, visarg, sthan, poshan, uti, manvantar-katha, ishanu-katha, nirodh, mukti, ashray." This verse explains that when a mumukshu establishes a firm belief of Shree Krishna Bhagvan, who a person should take the refuge of and who can be realised through the nine characteristics, then he will never have a doubt. For example, once a person has firmly realised that this is a mango tree, then even if he is overcome by kam, krodh, lobh, he will not entertain any doubts such as, 'Is this a mango tree or not?' In the same way, regardless of whether a person has controlled his prans or not, if he has firm belief of the pratyaksha svarup of Shree Krishna Bhagvan – without any doubts whatsoever – then he has attained nirvikalp samadhi.
1.5 "However, someone may repeatedly have doubts in his mind about Bhagvan's nature. For example, he may think, 'What must Bhagvan's svarup be like in Akshardham? What must His svarup be like in Shvet-Dvip and Vaikunth? When will I have the darshan of that svarup?' He continues to have such doubts in his mind, but he does not feel fulfilled by realising that the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan that he has attained is the cause of everything. Even if he attains samadhi by Bhagvan's wish, his doubts are never eradicated. No matter what he sees in samadhi, he always desires to see something new; the desires of his mind are never suppressed. Even if such a person experiences samadhi, it is savikalp samadhi; and even if he does not experience samadhi, it is still savikalp samadhi. Therefore, such a person cannot be called a gunatit, ekantik bhakta. A person who does have firm nishchay in Bhagvan, regardless of whether he has samadhi or not, can be said to have constant nirvikalp samadhi."
1.6 Then, Dina-Nath Bhatt asked, "What will become of a person who fails to conquer the mind, despite attempting to eradicate the desires in his mind?"
1.7 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "As the war between the Kauravs and the Pandavs was set to begin, the Kauravs and the Pandavs thought, 'Let us engage in the battle in such a holy place that even if we are killed in the fighting, our jeev will still benefit.' With this thought in mind, they eventually fought a battle, attained Dev-Lok, and obtained happiness greater than that of ruling over a kingdom.
1.8 "Therefore, regarding a person who takes up a fight with his mind – if he wins, then he attains nirvikalp samadhi and becomes an ekantik bhakta of Bhagvan. However, if he should lose to his mind, he falls from his spiritual activities. Then, maybe after one life or two lives or even after many lives, he will become an ekantik bhakta; but, his efforts will not have been useless.
1.9 "Therefore, a person who is wise should definitely develop hatred towards his mind for the sake of his kalyan. Then, if he conquers his mind, he is sure to benefit; but, even if he is defeated by his mind, he will eventually return to the path of enlightenment which is also beneficial in the end. Therefore, a person who aspires for kalyan should most certainly develop hatred towards his mind."

Vadtal – 2
Realising Bhagvan Through The Five Shastras
2.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Kartik sud 13 [22nd November 1825], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead under a mango tree on the banks of Lake Gomti, north of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was wearing a surval made from yellow, silken cloth and a red dagli made from kinkhab. He had also tied a pagh around His head using an orange cloth with a brocaded border. An orange shelu with a brocaded border was placed upon His shoulder. In addition to this, His pagh was decorated with garlands of champa flowers, and garlands of white flowers were hanging around His neck. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
2.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please begin a question-answer discussion."
2.3 Then, Kandasji Patel of the village Buva folded his hands and asked, "Maharaj, by what means does Bhagvan become pleased?"
2.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If we do not insult Bhagvan, then Bhagvan becomes pleased. Then, you may ask, 'What does it mean to criticise Bhagvan?' Well, Bhagvan is the all-doer of this world. However, if a person does not understand Him to be the all-doer and instead believes that it is Kal that is the all-doer of this world, or that it is Maya, or that it is karma, or that is the svabhav that is the all-doer, then he is insulting Bhagvan. This is because actually Bhagvan is the all-doer. To ignore this and to claim that only Kal, karma, Maya, and svabhav are the all-doers of this world is serious against Bhagvan.
2.5 "For example, you are the Patel (chief of a village) of your village. If someone does not acknowledge your status in the village, then he can be said to be your slanderer. Also, if someone does not accept the control of an emperor of the world, but instead accepts the control of a person who is not even a king, then that man is known as a slanderer of the emperor. If a person writes and distributes letters stating, 'Our king has no nose and ears; he has no hands or feet', and therefore, describes the king as being deformed even though he has a normal body, then he is also known as a slanderer of the king. Similarly, Bhagvan is complete, with limbs, hands, and feet. There is not the slightest deformation in any of His limbs. He eternally possesses a definite svarup. So, to say that He is not the all-doer and is nirakar, and that Kal, Maya, karma are the cause of all – not Bhagvan – is equivalent to insulting Bhagvan.
2.6 "A person who does not insult Bhagvan in this way is said to have performed perfect puja of Bhagvan. Otherwise, without such an understanding, even if a person performs puja by offering items like sandalwood paste and flowers, he is still a slanderer of Bhagvan. Therefore, Bhagvan is only pleased upon a person who realises Bhagvan to possess a definite svarup and to be the creator, sustainer, and destroyer of the universe.
2.7 "In the Veds, Bhagvan Himself has described His nature in many ways, but no one could understand it. Then, the Sankhya shastras prescribed the twenty-four tattvas and said that Bhagvan is the twenty-fifth tattva. The acharya of the Sankhya philosophy, Kapil Muni, thought, 'The jeev behaves as if it is one with the three types of bodies (sthul, sukshma, and karan) and it cannot remain separate from them. The ishvar also behaves as if it is one with its three bodies (virat, sutratma, and avyakrut) and it too cannot remain separate from them.' Therefore, the Sankhya shastras count jeev and ishvar amongst the twenty-four tattvas and claim Paramatma to be the twenty-fifth tattva.
2.8 "The acharya of the Yog shastras, Hiranyagarbh Rushi, explains that there are twenty-four tattvas, and that jeev and ishvar are the twenty-fifth tattva; but, Paramatma is the twenty-sixth.
2.9 "This is how the Sankhya shastras and the Yog shastras described Bhagvan's nature; still, no one attained understanding of the nature of the Bhagvan as He is. So, according to the Sankhya shastras, it was concluded, 'Whatever is greater than the twenty-four elements is satya'; and according to the Yog shastras, it was concluded, 'Paramatma, who is greater than jeev and ishvar, who themselves is beyond the twenty-four elements, is satya'. In this way, through these two philosophies, the nature of Bhagvan was realised. However, is that Bhagvan black, or yellow? Is He tall, or short? Is He sakar, or nirakar? That was not realised.
2.10 "Then, Vasudev Bhagvan composed the Panch-Ratra Tantra, in which he explained, 'In his own Akshardham, Shree Krishna Purushottam Bhagvan eternally possesses a divya sakar murti. This Bhagvan gives darshan five times to the countless niranna-muktas of Shvet-Dvip. In Vaikunth, that same Bhagvan assumes a four-armed form, holding a shankh, a chakra, a gada, and a padma. Along with Him is Lakshmiji. He is also served by Vishvaksen and other parshads. It is that same Bhagvan who is worthy of being offered puja, worthy of worship and worthy of attainment. It is that same Bhagvan who assumes the avatars of Ram and Krishna, and who appears in the four forms of Vasudev, Sankarshan, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha'. In this way, Vasudev Bhagvan explained that Bhagvan possesses a sakar murti.
2.11 "Then, Naradji revised that same Panch-Ratra Tantra, after which it came to be known as the Narad Panch-Ratra. In that, Bhagvan's svarup was explained in such a way that not even the slightest doubt remained. Also, Shivji explained the four-armed svarup and eight-armed svarup of Bhagvan in the Pashupat- Shastra.
2.12 "Therefore, the Shreemad Bhagvat states: narayana-para veda deva narayan-angajaha narayana-para loka narayana-para makhaha narayana-paro yogo narayana-param tapaha narayana-param gnanam narayana-para gatihi." The Veds are devoted to Narayan, and the essence of the Veds is Narayan; the devs are all formed from the svarup of Narayan; the loks are all devoted to Narayan, and all the loks are pervaded by Narayan; all yagnas are devoted to Narayan. All yog is devoted to Narayan; all tap is devoted to Narayan; all gnan is devoted to Narayan; and Narayan is the objective of all activities. vasudeva-para veda vasudeva-para makhaha vasudeva-para yoga vasudeva-paraha kriyaha vasudeva-param gnanam vasudeva-param tapaha vasudeva-paro dharmo vasudeva-para gatihi : The Veds are devoted to Vasudev, and the essence of the Veds is Vasudev; all yagnas are devoted to Vasudev; all yog is devoted to Vasudev; all activities are devoted to Vasudev. All gnan is devoted to Vasudev; all tap is devoted to Vasudev; all dharma is devoted to Vasudev; and Vasudev is the objective of all activities.
2.13 "Therefore, the five shastras have described the nature of Shree Krishna Vasudev only. Only a person who realises Bhagvan through these five shastras can be said to possess total gnan. For example, only when a person sees with his eyes does he come to know that milk is white; only when he smells with his nose does he come to know its smell; only when he touches it with his finger does he come to know whether it is hot or cold; and only when he tastes it with his tongue does he come to know its taste. In this way, only when milk is tested through all the indriyas can a person totally know its nature; it cannot be totally known through one indriya alone. Similarly, a person realises Bhagvan's nature totally when he realises it through the five shastras. To have such knowledge is called total gnan.
2.14 "Bhagvan is pleased only upon someone who has such understanding; there is no other means of pleasing Him. Therefore, only a person who has this understanding can be said to possess total gnan, and Bhagvan becomes extremely pleased only upon such a person."

Bhakti Coupled With Bhagvan's Greatness 
3.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Kartik vad 11 [6th December 1825], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a sinhasan in the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. He was also wearing garlands of roses around His neck, and tassels decorated the pagh upon His head. A sabha of all the munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
3.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "In our Uddhav Sampraday a person who has dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti towards Bhagvan is called an ekantik bhakta, and only he is worthy of being made renowned in our satsang. However, if these four qualities are not perfect and only one is predominant, then which of the four is the best, and incorporates the other three?"
3.3 Gopalanand Swami and Muktanand Swami replied, "Maharaj, dharma is the best, because if there is dharma then the other three qualities will eventually develop in that person."
3.4 To this, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Dharma may be present even in those who are vimukhs. Does that mean that we should make them renowned in satsang?"
3.5 Hearing this argument, no one could give a reply to the question. Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "If a person has bhakti towards Bhagvan coupled with knowledge of His greatness, he will never fall from dharma – even if he has a lesser degree of atma- nishtha, vairagya, and dharma. This is because a person who realises Bhagvan's greatness, thinks, 'If Brahma and all the other devs follow Bhagvan's agna, then how can I not follow His agna?' Bearing this in mind, he always abides by the niyams prescribed by Bhagvan."
3.6 Then, Shuk Muni asked, "If bhakti coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness alone is enough, why are all four qualities prescribed as essential, and not just bhakti alone?"
3.7 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a person has intense bhakti for Bhagvan coupled with the knowledge of His greatness, then all three are incorporated in bhakti alone. But, if his bhakti is of a medium intensity, then the other three are not incorporated within it. Therefore, it is said, 'A person who has the type of bhakti which include all four qualities can be called an ekantik bhakta'.
3.8 "Pruthu Raja had such extraordinary bhakti. When Bhagvan awarded a vardan upon him, he asked for ten thousand ears in order to hear kathas related to Bhagvan; he did not ask for anything else. Also, some gopis who were forbidden to go and play ras discarded their bodies and went to Shree Krishna in spirit. If a person has such extraordinary bhakti, then the other three qualities are all incorporated in bhakti alone."
3.9 Brahmanand Swami then asked, "By what means can such extraordinary bhakti be attained?"
3.10 Then, Shreeji Maharaj replied, "It is attained by serving a great sant. There are four types of great sant. One is like a small flame, the second is like a torch, the third is like lightning, and the fourth is like the vadvanal fire.
3.11 "A person, who is like a small flame, is extinguished by the wind in the form of the vishays. A person, who is like a torch, is extinguished by stronger gusts of wind in the form of the vishays. A person, who is like lightning, is not extinguished even by rainwater in the form of maya. However, vadvanal fire stays in the ocean without being extinguished by the ocean water; it drinks the sea water and excretes it in the form of sweet water; in turn, the clouds carry this water and shower it upon the world; and from this, many types of tastes are formed. Similarly, a great sant, like the vadvanal fire, transforms even the 'salty' jeevs who are like the saline sea water, into 'sweet' jeevs.
3.12 "Of the four types of great sant just described, if a person serves someone who is like lightning or the vadvanal fire – by thought, word, and deed, and while staying within his dharma – then bhakti coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness develops in that person.
3.13 "Also, a person should realise that the person who is like lightning is known as Bhagvan's ekantik sadhu – who is in sadhan- dasha. The person who is like the vadvanal fire is known as Bhagvan's great ekantik sant – who has attained siddh- dasha."

The Thirty Qualities Of A Sant
4.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Magshar sud 10 [19th December 1825], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
4.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please being a question-answer discussion."
4.3 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "For a bhakta of Bhagvan who has taken the path of bhakti, which one spiritual activity includes all the other activities for kalyan?"
4.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "All the spiritual activities for attaining kalyan are included in keeping the company – by thought, word, and deed – of a sant who possesses the thirty qualities of a sadhu."
4.5 After replying to the question, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Suppose there is an ekantik bhakta yogi who realises that the philosophy of both the Sankhya shastras and the Yog shastras is based upon only Vasudev-Narayan. By what means does that yogi fix his vrutti on Bhagvan's murti? How does he control his mind? How does he keep his vrutti facing inwards? How does he keep his vrutti facing outwards? By which of his yogic abilities does he separate himself from the obstacles of disturbing thoughts and desires, as well as from the absorption of sleep? Please answer these questions."
4.6 Then, Muktanand Swami and Gopalanand Swami attempted to answer these questions to the best of their ability, but neither of them was able to give a satisfactory reply. So, Shreeji Maharaj said, "When water goes into a fountain, it first revolves in a spiral and then spurts upwards; in the same way, the vrutti of the jeev revolves in a spiral in the antah-karans, which acts like the fountain, and then spurts out through the five indriyas. A yogi does this in two ways: With one vrutti, he thinks of Shree Vasudev Bhagvan who resides in his heart as a witness. With the second vrutti he faces outwards through his eyes, and he thinks about Bhagvan who is outside. He thinks of the whole murti from head to toe; he does not only think of a single part of the body. Just as when a person looks at a large mandir, he sees it completely as a whole; or when a person looks at a large mountain, he sees it totally; similarly, the yogi sees Bhagvan's murti in the same way, but he does not see each part of Bhagvan's body separately.
4.7 "When he observes the murti at a distance through his eyes, if he sees some other object besides Bhagvan, then he draws that murti of Bhagvan closer and observes it at the tip of his nose. Even after doing this, if he still sees some object nearby, then he observes the murti of Bhagvan between his eyebrows. While doing this, if he feels lazy or sleepy, then he would again observe the murti of Bhagvan before his eyes. Then, in the same way that a child flies a kite, he would fly a kite ( Bhagvan's murti) with a string ( vrutti). He would make it rise upwards, then bring it down again, and then make it sweep from side to side. Using his yogic powers in this way, when he becomes alert, he would again observe the murti at the tip of his nose, and from there he would bring it between his eyebrows, and then he would draw it into his heart. Then, he would merge together both the murti of Bhagvan that resides in his heart as a witness, and the murti of Bhagvan that is outside. At this point, the two vruttis of the antah-karans become one.
4.8 "While doing this, if he feels lazy or sleepy again, then he would bring the murti outside again using the two types of vruttis. In the same way as with his eyes, he would use his ears, hands, tongue, and nose to perfect yog. Also, he would observe Bhagvan's murti with his man, buddhi, chitt, and ahankar. Then, by using the sankhya thought process, he would distinguish himself from his indriyas and antah-karans and would observe only the murti of Bhagvan in his chaitanya. While he is beholding the form, whether it be inside or outside, if some disturbance regarding worldly affairs obstructs him, then he would remove the problem while continuing to observe the murti; but, he would not abandon his yogic activities because of the disturbance. This is how a yogi with such yogic powers behaves."

Vadtal – 5
A Bhakta Should Not Perceive Maya In Bhagvan
5.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Magshar vad 4, [29th December 1825], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting facing north on a decorated seat under a mango tree along the banks of Lake Gomti, north of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in extremely fine, white clothes, and He had several garlands of roses hanging around His neck. Bunches of two large roses had been placed upon His ears, and tassels of roses decorated His pagh. A sabha of all the munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
5.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please ask complex questions in order to relieve everyone's tiredness." Having said that, Maharaj put a pillow facing west and lay down.
5.3 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "Shree Krishna Bhagvan has said: daivee hyesha guna-mayee mama maya duratyaya mam-eva ye prapadyante mayam-etam taranti te" This verse means, 'A person who attains me will break through my Maya, which is composed of the three gun, and which cannot otherwise be broken through even by suffering hardships'. However, even after a person has attained Bhagvan, he is still disturbed by thoughts and desires in his heart during the worship of Bhagvan. What else, besides Maya, could be causing this? That is the question."
5.4 Shreeji Maharaj sat upright from His lying posture, and with great compassion said, "Of the three gun of Maya, tamo-gun is predominant in the five bhuts, and the five tan-matras; rajo-gun is predominant in the ten indriyas, the buddhi, and the prans; and sattva- gun is predominant in the man and the presiding devs of the indriyas and antah-karans. In the past, all those who have become bhaktas have possessed the products of the three gun – the bhuts, the indriyas, the antah-karans, and their presiding devs. Therefore, the answer to the question is as follows: A person who has the firm belief of Bhagvan – who has realised Bhagvan completely by believing that there are no mayik qualities in His svarup, and that Bhagvan is greater than Maya and the products of Maya (the three gun) – has gone beyond Bhagvan's Maya. Even though he has the products of the gun of maya within him (the bhuts, the indriyas, the antah-karans, and their presiding devs, each of which carries out its respective activities) he is still said to have gone beyond Maya. This is because even though the products of Maya are within him, he still realises that the pratyaksha svarup of Shree Vasudev Bhagvan, who is worthy to be worshipped by him, is beyond the gun of Maya; therefore, he himself should also be known to have gone beyond Maya.
5.5 "Even the shastras acknowledge that the gun seem to have influenced all, including the devs and the rushis. Does that imply that they cannot be called muktas? Also, does that imply that they cannot be said to have gone beyond Maya? In fact, they are all muktas, and they have all gone beyond Maya. If we do not answer in this way then there is no other possible solution to that question. Therefore, this is the only answer."
5.6 Then, Nityanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, people go to seek the refuge of Bhagvan. Then, what are the characteristics of having the refuge of Bhagvan?"
5.7 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Bhagvan has said in the Geeta, sarva-dharman-parityajya mam-ekam sharanam vraja aham tva sarva-papebhyo mokshayishyami ma shuchaha" In this verse he says, 'Abandon all other forms of dharma and surrender only to me. I shall deliver you from all sins, so do not grieve'. A person who has such a firm refuge of Bhagvan, even if he were to experience pain equivalent to that of final destruction, he would not believe anyone else to be his guardian against such misery, except Bhagvan. Moreover, whatever happiness he wishes for, he seeks to attain only from Bhagvan. He does not consider anyone but Bhagvan to be the source of happiness. Moreover, he behaves only according to the wishes of Bhagvan. Such a person can be known to have taken refuge in Bhagvan. It is he who can be called a firm bhakta of Bhagvan."
5.8 Then, Naja Bhakta asked, "How can a person recognise someone who, when he speaks, shows that he has nishchay in Bhagvan like that of a bhakta, but does not truly have the total refuge of Bhagvan?"
5.9 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Only after staying together and working together can a person recognise the strength or weakness of the nishchay of a bhakta of Bhagvan. A person who has little nishchay would become distressed and find a path out of satsang. He would seek privacy where he could engage in worship to his capacity, but he would not be able to tolerate the pressures of living in the company of bhaktas. Therefore, refuge of Bhagvan is of three levels: uttam, madhyam, and kanishth. Due to this, there are three levels of bhaktas."
5.10 Then, Nityanand Swami asked, "Can a bhakta who is of the kanishth level eradicate his deficiency and become a bhakta of the uttam level in this very life, or not?"
5.11 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Just as a bhakta performs the mansi puja of Bhagvan, a person should also performs the mansi puja of the uttam bhakta along with Bhagvan, by offering him the prasad of Bhagvan; and just as a bhakta prepares a thal for Bhagvan, a person should also prepare a thal for Bhagvan's uttam bhakta and serve it to him; and just as a bhakta donates five rupees to Bhagvan, a person should also donates money to the great sant. Then, by performing seva of Bhagvan and His sant, who possesses the highest qualities, with extreme love – even if he is a bhakta of the kanishth type and was destined to become a bhakta of the highest type after two lives, or after four lives, or after ten lives, or after a hundred lives – he will become a bhakta of the uttam level in this very life. These are the rewards of the seva of Bhagvan and His bhaktas."

The Jeev Remains Within Maya After Destruction 
6.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Magshar vad 11 [4th January 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a platform in front of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Garlands of flowers had been placed around His neck, and tassels of flowers were also hanging from His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
6.2 Then, Chiman-Ravji asked, "Maharaj, initially, at the time of destruction, the jeevs with their karan bodies were absorbed within Maya. Then, at the time of creation, the jeevs attained their sthul and sukshma bodies. Also, a variety of life ( devs, humans, animals, and plants) was created. Was this due to karmas? Or was it due to Bhagvan's wish? If we say that it was due to karmas, then that would prove the Jain philosophy to be true. On the other hand, if we say that it was due to Bhagvan's wish, then it would suggest that Bhagvan is biased and not compassionate. Therefore, please grace us by telling us how things really are."
6.3 Shreeji Maharaj said, "You have not been able to ask the question properly. The sthul and sukshma bodies are both closely associated with the karan body in the same way that a tree is closely associated with its seed. That is why it is called the karan body. This karan body is a form of avidya; it is without a beginning; and it retains its sanchit karmas. Just as a seed and its shell have an eternal relationship, and just as pruthvi and smell have an eternal relationship, similarly, the jeev and the karan body have an eternal relationship. Just as when planted seeds sprout upwards after coming into contact with rainwater, similarly, during the period of creation, the jeevs, which had resided within Maya together with their karan bodies, attain various types of bodies according to their individual karmas by the will of Bhagvan, the giver of the rewards of karmas.
6.4 "However, the Jains, who are nastiks, claim that only karmas are the cause of this, but they do not describe Bhagvan as the giver of the fruits of karmas. However, in reality, this belief of those nastiks is wrong. Therefore, if someone claims that kal is the only influencing force, then he is not correct; or, if someone claims that karma is the only influencing force, then he is not correct; or, if someone claims that Bhagvan's wish is the only influencing force, then even he is not correct. The shastras would describe the predominance of whichever influence is predominant at that time; but that same influence should not be accepted for all situations.
6.5 "This is because after the world was created, in the first Satya-Yug, everyone's wishes came true, all were brahmans, and a child would be born merely by mentally wishing for one. There was a kalpa-vruksh in every home, and all people worshipped only Bhagvan. Then, with the arrival of Treta-Yug, people's wishes were no longer fulfilled; only when a person went and stood under a kalpa-vruksh did his wishes become fulfilled; and only after touching a woman would a child be conceived. Then, when Dvapar-Yug arrived, children were born only after physical association with a woman. However, the ways of Satya-Yug and Treta- Yug are not to be found in all Satya- Yugs and Treta- Yugs; they were found only in the first Satya-Yug and the first Treta- Yug.
6.6 "Therefore, when there is the predominance of pleasant kal, it diminishes the power of the impure karmas of the jeevs. However, when a terrible famine strikes, everyone suffers; or when there is a horrendous war, hundreds of thousands of people are killed at once. In these cases were everyone's pleasant karmas suddenly used up at the same time? Instead, it is the intense power of unpleasant kal that overcomes the force of the pleasant karmas of the jeevs. So, when the influence of intense kal prevails, karmas have no influence; due to the influence of kal, karmas that should have resulted in happiness lead to misery, and karmas that should have resulted in long life lead to death. In this way, when the influence of a strong kal is prevalent, everything occurs due to kal. This is mentioned in the shastras.
6.7 "However, when many people become ekantik bhaktas of Bhagvan, then Satya- Yug prevails even in Kali-Yug. In these circumstances, the shastras describe the strength of the pleasant karmas that result from the ekantik bhaktas performing bhakti of Bhagvan, but the strength of kal is not mentioned.
6.8 "Without understanding this principle, those who believe in the nastik philosophy describes that only karmas are the cause of everything; but, they do not realise that the principle is in reference to the strength of the karmas of ekantik bhaktas of Bhagvan. However, karmas of vimukhs are not said to have such strength. When Bhagvan takes birth with the wish, 'During this lifespan, I wish to grant kalyan to all jeevs, both worthy and unworthy, who come into contact with my murti', then kal and karma have no influence whatsoever. At that time, only Bhagvan's influence prevails. When Bhagvan assumed the avatar of Krishna, the evil Putna tried to poison Bhagvan; still, Shree Krishna Bhagvan gave her the same fate as His mother Yashoda. There were other evil demons that came to kill Bhagvan; but, even they were granted Akshardham by Shree Krishna Bhagvan. Others were also granted kalyan according to the feelings by which they were associated with Shree Krishna Bhagvan. Therefore, in those instances, only Bhagvan's influence is said to be prevalent, but neither kal nor karma is said to have any influences. Therefore, a person should interpret situations according to the circumstances in which they occur."

The Characteristics Of Religious And Demonic People
7.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Magshar vad 14 [7th January 1826], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a platform in front of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
7.2 In the sabha, the bhaktas were talking about Bhagvan amongst themselves, when the topic arose that there are two types of people: religious and demonic. Of these, religious people always become bhaktas of Bhagvan, whereas the demonic will always remain opposed to Bhagvan.
7.3 Then, Chiman-Ravji asked a question: "Maharaj is there any possibility of a demonic person becoming religious?"
7.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A demonic person most certainly does not become religious. This is because he has a demonic nature from birth. If such a person somehow enters satsang, he still does not lose his demonic nature. Then, when he leaves his physical body after staying in satsang, he is absorbed into brahm and then emerges out again. Only after he does so countless times is his demonic nature destroyed; otherwise, it is not destroyed."
7.5 Then, Shobha-Ram Shastri asked, "Maharaj, what is Bhagvan's anvay nature, and what is His vyatirek nature?"
7.6 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The principle of anvay-vyatirek is not that Bhagvan has become half anvay within Maya and half vyatirek svarup His dham. Instead, Bhagvan's svarup is such that He is anvay within Maya, and at the same time, He is vyatirek. Bhagvan is not afraid, 'What if I enter Maya and then become impure?' Instead, when Bhagvan associates with Maya, even Maya becomes like Akshardham; and if He associates with the twenty-four tattvas, then they also become brahm-rup. Therefore, the Shreemad Bhagvat states: dhamna svena sada nirasta-kuhakam satyam param dheemahi : We perform dhyan upon Bhagvan, who destroyed the deception via His own svarup, in the form of the products of Maya. This is the supremely satya svarup of Bhagvan. "In this way, there are countless such statements which describe Bhagvan's svarup.
7.7 "For example, there is akash in the seed of a tree; and when a tree grows from that seed, akash will still remain within all of its branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits in its anvay form. However, when the tree is cut, akash is not cut along with it; and when the tree is burnt, akash is not burnt. In the same way, Bhagvan is anvay within Maya and the entities that have evolved from it; but, He is also vyatirek from it just like akash. This is the anvay- vyatirek nature of Bhagvan's svarup."

Becoming Like Bhagvan - A Spider's Web
8.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh sud 4 [12th January 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a platform in front of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
8.2 In the sabha, Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in a meditative posture and thinking. Some of the munis were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a dukad and saroda. He gave darshan in this way for a short while. Then, He opened His eyes and said, "Everyone please listen as I wish to speak to you. The vrutti of these eyes is formless; but, if some solid object comes in its way, that vrutti is obstructed. Therefore, that vrutti is actually physical and is composed predominantly of the tattva of pruthvi. When a bhakta of Bhagvan fixes that vrutti on Bhagvan's murti, the vrutti initially appears like a thin yellow rope. Just as a spider stretches its web from one pillar to another, and then sometimes goes to one pillar, then to the other pillar, or sometimes sits between the two pillars, similarly, the jeev is like the spider; Bhagvan's murti is one of the pillars, the antah-karans are the other pillar, and the vrutti is the web. Through that vrutti, a meditating yogi sometimes becomes absorbed in Bhagvan's murti; at times, he stays within his own antah-karans; and at other times, he stays between his antah-karans and Bhagvan.
8.3 "While doing this, when the yellow vrutti, which is composed predominantly of the tattva of pruthvi, becomes predominantly jal, it appears to be white; when it becomes predominantly tej, it appears to be red; when it becomes predominantly vayu, it appears to be green; and when it becomes predominantly akash, it appears to be dark. Finally, when the vrutti sheds the predominance of the five bhuts and becomes nirgun, it appears to be extremely radiant and assumes the svarup of Bhagvan.
8.4 "Therefore, a person who tries to maintain his vrutti on Bhagvan's svarup in this way should remain perfectly pure. For example, when a person wishes to offer puja to a dev, the dev accepts the puja only after the person becomes as pure as the dev. Similarly, a person who keeps his vrutti on Bhagvan's svarup should realise his own self to be distinct from the three bodies ( sthul, sukshma, and karan), in accordance with the method prescribed in the Sankhya shastras; and only after attaining atma- nishtha, should he fix his vrutti on Bhagvan's svarup. While repeatedly fixing his vrutti in this way, when his vrutti is eventually absorbed into Bhagvan's svarup, that state has been defined as sleep for a yogi performing dhyan; but, a yogi's sleep is never like the state sushupti."

How Can A Person Experience The Nirgun Bliss Of Bhagvan?
9.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh sud 8 [16th January 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a platform in front of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
9.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked the munis, "Just as a person can experience the three kinds of mayik pleasures – rajas, tamasi, and sattvik – in the three mental states, how can he experience the nirgun bliss of Bhagvan?"
9.3 All the munis conferred amongst themselves in order to answer the question, but they were unable to do so satisfactorily.
9.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Suppose there is akash alone, without the other four bhuts. Also, suppose that in that akash there are many moons as there are stars. Then, the intensity of that light would be equal to the intensity of the divine light of Chidakash. The murti of Bhagvan is always seated at the centre of that Chidakash.
9.5 "When a person attains samadhi of that form, then even if he experiences it for only a moment, the person who is engaged in worship feels, 'I have enjoyed the bliss of Bhagvan in samadhi for thousands of years'. This is how a person experiences the nirgun bliss of Bhagvan's svarup. On the other hand, even if a person indulges in mayik pleasures for a long time, he feels as if it was just for a moment. Therefore, the nirgun bliss of Bhagvan is eternal and imperishable, whereas the mayik pleasures are perishable."

Vadtal – 10
Realising Bhagvan In The Svarup Of A King Or Sadhu
10.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh sud 11 [19th January 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow which had been placed on a wooden bedstead under the neem tree outside the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
10.2 Then, Bhagu-Bhai Patidar of the village Bhadran arrived in the sabha and asked, "Maharaj, how can the jeev attain kalyan?"
10.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Bhagvan assumes an avatar on this earth in one of two svarups: the svarup of the king, or in the svarup of a sadhu. When He assumes an avatar upon the earth in the svarup of a king, He possesses the thirty-nine characteristics of a king; and when He assumes an avatar upon the earth in the svarup of a sadhu, He possesses the thirty characteristics of a sadhu.
10.4 "When Bhagvan appears in the svarup a king, He is educated in the sixty-four sciences, arts, and skills of a royal household; the four methods of ruling (reconciling with enemies, suppressing enemies, instigating divisions within enemies, and punishing enemies); as well as the nine types of sentiments and emotions, such as affection, humour, sadness, courage, and tranquillity. However, when Bhagvan appears in the svarup of a sadhu, he does not have these characteristics. When Bhagvan is in the svarup of a king, He may even take to hunting to survive in times of disaster. He may punish thieves by strangling them, and He may also keep many women in His household. However, in the svarup of a sadhu, Bhagvan strictly follows a non-violent lifestyle; He would not even pluck a blade of green grass. Also, He would not touch even wooden statues of women or paintings of women. Therefore, the behaviour of Bhagvan in the svarup of a sadhu is not the same as that of Bhagvan in the svarup of a king.
10.5 "The thirty-nine characteristics of Bhagvan's avatars in the svarup of a king ( Shree Krishna and Shree Ram) are listed in the first skandh of the Shreemad Bhagvat through the discussion between Pruthvi and Dharma. The thirty characteristics of Bhagvan's avatars in the svarup of a sadhu ( Dattatrey and Kapil- Dev) are listed in the eleventh skandh through the discussion between Shree Krishna Bhagvan and Uddhav.
10.6 "Therefore, a person who desires kalyan should recognise Bhagvan through these characteristics and seek refuge of that Bhagvan. He should have complete faith in Him, and He should perform His bhakti while following His agna. This is the only means of attaining kalyan.
10.7 "However, when Bhagvan is not pratyaksha on this earth, a person should seek the refuge of a sant who has the realisation of Bhagvan – because the jeev can also attain kalyan through him. When such a sant is not present, He should keep firm faith in Bhagvan's murti and perform bhakti while observing svadharma, as this can also grant kalyan to the jeev."

The Destruction Of The Jeev
11.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh sud Punam [23rd January 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a wooden bedstead under the neem tree outside the mandir of Shree Lakshmi- Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. He was also wearing garlands of white flowers around His neck. In addition to this, bunches of flowers were placed above His ears, and tassels of flowers were also hanging from His pagh. A sabha of all the munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
11.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "My nature is such that I feel extremely afraid of harming any of the following: Bhagvan, a bhakta of Bhagvan, a brahman, and a person who is humble. Other than these four, I am afraid of no one. This is because even if a person were to harm anyone else, his body would be destroyed; the jeev would not be destroyed. However, if a person harms one of these four, then his jeev is also destroyed."
11.3 Hearing his, Muktanand Swami questioned, "Maharaj, the jeev is said to be indestructible. Then, what should one understand by its 'destruction'?"
11.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A jeev that attains a jad svarup, such as the body of a mountain, will never attain kalyan. This should be understood as the 'destruction' of that jeev. Therefore, anyone who seeks kalyan should never harm Bhagvan, a bhakta of Bhagvan, a brahman, and a person who is humble.
11.5 "Also, a person should never keep man of any sort before Bhagvan or His bhakta. This is because man is the cause of krodh, matsar, irshya, and slander. In fact, even the bhakti of a person with man is said to be demonic. Moreover, if a person oppresses a bhakta of Bhagvan, then even if he himself is a bhakta, he should be known to be a demon. My nature is such that I hate even the sight of a person who harms a brahman, a humble person, or a bhakta of Bhagvan. Such a person will never attain my company, either in this lok or in other loks."
11.6 Having spoken in this way, Shreeji Maharaj asked for two kirtans to be sung. The first was 'Mara Harjishu Het Na Dise Re, Tene Gher Shid Jaiye...' – why should a person even visit the home of a person who has no love for my lord? The second was 'Mara Vahaljishu Valap Dise Re, Teno Sang Kem Tajiye...' – why should a person abandon the company of a person who has love for my lord? Shreeji Maharaj then gave an agna that all satsangis should learn these two kirtans, and added, "A person should constantly sing these two kirtans and remember their message."
11.7 Then, Shreeji Maharaj got up and sat on a platform in front of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi- Narayan.
11.8 Gopalanand Swami then asked, "Why is it that despite reading the six- shastras, the Purans, and other shastras, the pandits of the world still do not understand the greatness of Bhagvan and His sant as it really is?"
11.9 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Though such a person reads the shastras the Purans, he does not have the refuge of Bhagvan. Therefore, his jeev has been overpowered by inner enemies, such as kam, krodh, lobh, irshya, and matsar. These inner enemies never allow him to even raise his head. As a result, the pandits perceive Bhagvan and His sant to be just like themselves. They think, 'Just as the inner enemies of within us are never eradicated, similarly, the same enemies are probably not eradicated from them either'. In this way, they perceive faults in Bhagvan and His sant. So, even though they read the shastras and Purans, they fail to realise the greatness of Bhagvan and His sant as it really is."
11.10 Next, Shreeji Maharaj posed a question to Dina-Nath Bhatt and all the munis: "The sat-purush, who is brahm-svarup, behaves above the three bodies and the three mental states. Also, he does not believe any of the actions of the fourteen indriyas to affect him. However, an ignorant person cannot realise this. Only when he attains a sthiti similar to that of the sat-purush does he behave like the sat-purush, and only then does he understand the great sant's behaviour. So, as long as a person has not realised the greatness of the sat-purush, he does not attain the sthiti of being brahm-svarup. However, without atma- nishtha, a person cannot realise the greatness of the sat-purush. Therefore, there seems to be a paradox. Now, please example how this paradox can be resolved?"
11.11 Everyone attempted to answer to the best of their ability, but no one was able to give a solution to the question.
11.12 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Here, allow me to answer. The answer is that when a person develops intense love for a sant who has realised the avatar of Bhagvan on this earth, he then never perceives any kind of avgun in the sat-purush. For example, when someone has strong love for someone, he will never see that person's avgun, and he will always believe the person's words. This is natural on the worldly path and it is also natural on the path of kalyan. Therefore, intense love for the sat-purush is the only means to realising a person's atma; it is the only means to realising the greatness of the sat-purush; and it is also the only means to having the direct darshan of Bhagvan."

The Rise And Fall Of The Jeev
12.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh vad 2 [25th January 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead with a cylindrical pillow on a wooden platform under the neem tree outside the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was wearing a white khes, and had covered Himself with a white pachhedi, over which He had wrapped a rose-coloured shawl. He had tied a white pagh around His head and was wearing a garland of roses around His neck. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
12.2 In the sabha, Shreeji Maharaj sat thinking for quite some time. He then opened His eyes and looked compassionately at the sabha of bhaktas, and said, "Today, I wish to talk to all of you about nishchay in Bhagvan, so please listen carefully. Shree Purushottam Bhagvan, whose svarup is forever divya, is seated in Akshardham, which is as luminous as countless millions of suns, moons, and flames of fire. That same Bhagvan assumes the avatars of Ram and Krishna, upon this earth for the sake of granting kalyan to the jeevs. Then, the jeev that develops firm nishchay in that Bhagvan by great association with a sant, progresses spiritually day by day, just like the waxing moon on the second day of the bright half of the lunar month. As the sun's effect on the moon increases, the waxing moon continues increasing. Then, when Punam finally arrives, the moon becomes full. Similarly, before developing total nishchay in Bhagvan, the jeev is as dim as the new moon of Amas – only as bright as a glow-worm. Then, as a person develops nishchay coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness, his jeevatma progresses and becomes like the full moon of Punam. Then, his indriyas and antah-karans are no longer capable of dislodging him from his nishchay. Regardless of the type of charitras Bhagvan performs, he does not perceive any fault in Bhagvan. In addition, a person who has nishchay in Bhagvan coupled with the knowledge of His greatness becomes a brave bhakta.
12.3 "However, if at some time that same bhakta has doubts in the charitras of Bhagvan, either by the influence of unpleasant kal, kriya, sang, dhyan, mantra, diksha, and shastra, or due to his identification with the body, then his jeev, which was like a full moon of Punam, becomes like the unlit moon of Amas. Therefore, some minor flaw in a person will not really harm the jeev very much; but, if he somehow doubts the charitras of Bhagvan, or if he somehow develops a dislike for Bhagvan, then that jeev instantly falls from the path of kalyan. Just as when the roots of a tree are cut, the tree automatically becomes dry, similarly, a jeev who perceives avgun in Bhagvan in any way can never stay without falling from the satsang.
12.4 "Moreover, a person whose nishchay in Bhagvan is weak, despite being in satsang, still doubts, 'Who knows whether I will attain kalyan or not? When I die, will I become a dev? Or will I become a king? Or will I become a ghost?' A person who does not have absolute nishchay in Bhagvan has such doubts. However, a person who does have absolute nishchay believes, 'I have attained kalyan ever since the day I attained Bhagvan. In fact, whoever has my darshan or listens to my talks will also be freed from all of his sins and will attain Akshardham'. So, maintaining such nishchay coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness, a person should believe himself to be fulfilled. All of you should constantly be aware of this fact."
12.5 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please sing the following kirtans describing Bhagvan's greatness: 'Dhanya Vrundavan Vasi Vat-Ni Chaya Re Jya Hari Besta...' – glorious are the shades of the banyan trees of Vrundavan, where the lord often sat'." Then, the kirtan was sung.
12.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "In the same way as the kirtan, Shree Krishna Bhagvan has also said in the Shreemad Bhagvat: aho amee devavara-mararchitam padam-bujam te sumanah-falarhanam naman-tyupadaya shikhabhir-atmanas-tamo-pahatyai taru-janma yat-krutam : These trees – which are worshipped by the chief dev (Indra) and all the other devs – offer fruits and flowers at your holy feet, and bow before you with their hands (their branches and leaves) to remove their darkness of ignorance which caused their birth as trees." So, even a person who is born as a tree becomes fulfilled by being associated with Bhagvan. In fact, even the tree under which Bhagvan has sat should be understood to be entitled to attain Akshardham.
12.7 "A person, who does not have such firm nishchay coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness in his heart, should be known to be impotent – no jeev is ever going to be saved by his words. For example, a king who is impotent, who is about to lose his kingdom, and whose family line is about to end, will still not be able to conceive a son with his wife. In fact, even if he summons other impotent men like himself from his entire kingdom and allows them to associate with his wife, she still will not conceive a son. Similarly, no one attains kalyan by hearing even shastras like the Geeta and the Shreemad Bhagvat from a person who does not have nishchay in Bhagvan coupled with the knowledge of His greatness. Just as death is certain for whoever drinks sweetened milk into which a snake's venom has fallen, similarly, no one can ever attain kalyan by listening to the Geeta or the Shreemad Bhagvat from a person who does not have nishchay in Bhagvan coupled with the knowledge of His greatness; only harm can come from it."

If Bhagvan Pervades All, How Can He Possess A Svarup?
13.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh vad 7 [30th January 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a wooden bedstead under the neem tree outside the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in white clothes, and was also wearing garlands of white flowers around His neck. In addition to this, a decorated umbrella with a golden, egg-shaped top-piece had been placed above Him. Shreeji Maharaj sat in such a charming way, tossing a pomegranate in His hand. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
13.2 Then, Bhagu-Bhai Patidar of Bhadran approached Shreeji Maharaj, and asked, "Maharaj, how does samadhi actually occur?"
13.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Bhagvan assumes an avatar in Bharat-Khand for the kalyan of jeevs. When He appears in the svarup of a king, he possesses the thirty-nine characteristics of a king; and when he appears in the svarup of a sadhu, such as Dattatrey or Kapil-Dev, he possesses the thirty characteristics of a sadhu. By appearance, Bhagvan's svarup appears similar to that of any human; however, it is an exceptionally divya svarup. For example, a magnetic rock appears similar to all the other rocks on the earth. However, there is an intrinsic magical property in it. When a ship sails past a mountain of magnetic rock, all the iron nails of the ship are drawn towards the magnetic rock. Similarly, when a person does darshan of Bhagvan's svarup with shraddha, be it the svarup of a king or the svarup of a sadhu, his indriyas are drawn towards Bhagvan. Then, he attains samadhi.
13.4 "Upon having the darshan of Shree Krishna Bhagvan, all the residents of Gokul attained samadhi; and in that samadhi, Bhagvan showed them His own dham. In this way, whenever there is an avatar of Bhagvan, then at that time, Bhagvan's svarup definitely possesses certain magical powers. Moreover, all the indriyas of anyone who does darshan of Bhagvan with shraddha are drawn towards Bhagvan, and he instantly enters samadhi. At the same time, if Bhagvan wishes to attract many people towards Him, then even people who are not bhaktas, and even animals, attain samadhi upon seeing Him. So, what is so surprising about this happening to a bhakta of Bhagvan?"
13.5 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "It is generally said that Brahm pervades everywhere. But, how can something that is pervasive be said to possess a svarup? Also, how can something that possesses a svarup be called pervasive? That is my question."
13.6 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Brahm resides in only one place, but not everywhere. That Brahm is Shree Krishna Bhagvan; He is in all places while still residing in only one place. For example, when a person worships Surya, he grants the person a vision like his own. Then, that person can see as far as Surya's vision reaches. Also, a person who has attained siddh-dasha can hear people who may be thousands of millions of miles away as if they are speaking next to him. In fact, he is able to pick up an object that may be millions of miles away, even though his arms are the same size as any other human's. Similarly, when Shree Krishna Bhagvan wishes to give darshan somewhere, He gives His darshan there while still residing in one place. Even though He has only one svarup, He appears in countless svarup s. In fact, if a person who is a yogi has extraordinary powers such as long-distance hearing and long-distance vision, then what is so surprising about Bhagvan also possessing such powers?
13.7 "So, even though the shastras describe Bhagvan as pervasive, He actually possesses a definite svarup. In those shastras, He is described as pervasive in the sense that using His own powers, He gives His darshan to all while still residing in one place. But, He is not pervasive in the sense of being nirakar like akash. So, in reality, Bhagvan eternally possesses a svarup. It is that Bhagvan with a definite svarup, who appears in countless millions of brahmands while always residing in Akshardham."

Even A Sinner Becomes Pure In The Refuge Of A Sat-Purush
14.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh vad 9 [1st February 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in front of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
14.2 Then, Ram-Chandra Vaghmodia of Vadodara asked, "Maharaj, why does a person who seems to be an unworthy person still attain samadhi?"
14.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Everyone believes that a person who disobeys the dharma of his varna and ashram as prescribed in the shastras is an 'unworthy person'. However, if that unworthy person sincerely appreciates the qualities of Bhagvan and His sant, he earns great rewards. As a result, the sins that he had committed by disobeying the dharma of his varna and ashram are eradicated, and his jeev becomes extremely pure. Then, when his mind is fixed on Bhagvan's svarup, he attains samadhi.
14.4 "Moreover, when a person abides by the dharma of his varna and ashram as prescribed in the Dharma-Shastras, everyone considers that person to be someone who is sincere in his dharma. However, if he criticises Bhagvan or His sant, then the result of committing the sin of criticising a sat-purush is such that all the rewards earned by abiding to the dharma of his varna and ashram are burnt to ashes. So, a person who criticises a sat-purush is a worse sinner than a person who has committed the five great sins. This is because he who has committed one of the five great sins can be redeemed of the sin by seeking the refuge of a sat-purush; but there are no means to be redeemed for a person who has criticised a sat-purush. This is because when a person goes to a place of pilgrimage, he is freed of the sins he has committed elsewhere; but the sins committed at a place of pilgrimage are totally irredeemable – it is as if they are etched in iron.
14.5 "Therefore, by seeking the refuge of a sat-purush, regardless of how terrible a sinner a person may be, he becomes extremely pure and attains samadhi. On the other hand, a person who criticises a sat-purush is still a terrible sinner, regardless of how sincere he may seem to be in abiding by dharma. Moreover, he can never have the darshan of Bhagvan in his heart. Therefore, whom a vimukh considers to be a sinner is not a sinner, and whom he considers to be sincere in his dharma is not really sincere."

Religious And Demonic Jeevs
15.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh vad 11 [3rd February 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a platform under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi- Narayan in Vadtal. He was wearing a dagli and a surval made of kinkhab. A rich, orange shelu with wide, golden edges had been tied around His head, and another orange shelu with very wide, golden edges rested upon His shoulder. In addition to this, a decorated umbrella with a golden, egg-shaped top-piece had been placed above Him. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
15.2 Then, Shobha-Ram Shastri asked a question: "Maharaj, there are two types of jeevs: religious and demonic. Have they always been like this since eternity, or have they become like this due to association?"
15.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "In the beginning, during the period of destruction, both types of jeevs, religious and demonic, are absorbed within Maya. Then, when the universe is created, both types of jeevs emerge, each with their own nature. There are also ordinary jeevs who become religious or demonic due to association with religious or demonic jeevs. Also, there are some religious and demonic jeevs who gradually develop such a nature due to the karmas they perform.
15.4 "However, the main cause of such religious and demonic natures is the grace or the fury of a sat-purush. For example, Jay and Vijay were parshads of Bhagvan, but since they insulted the religious Sanakadik, they attained a demonic nature. On the other hand, Prahladji was a demon, but since he absorbed the preaching of Naradji, he was known as a renowned bhakta of Bhagvan. Therefore, whomever the fury of a sat-purush falls upon, that jeev becomes demonic; and whomever a sat-purush is pleased upon, that jeev becomes religious. There is no other reason for becoming religious or demonic. Therefore, a person who desires to attain kalyan should by no means criticise Bhagvan or His bhaktas. Instead, he should do only whatever pleases Bhagvan and His bhaktas."

The Pleasures Of The Fourteen Loks
16.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh vad 13 [4th February 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a platform under the neem tree in front of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
16.2 Also sitting in the sabha was a shastri from Vadodara. He said, "Maharaj, if you show a miracle to some worldly, renowned man, then its effect will be very beneficial for the development of the satsang."
16.3 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I do not get along very well with such worldly, renowned men. After all, they have pride of their power and wealth, whereas I have pride of tyag and bhakti. Therefore, neither of us is in a position to surrender to the other. Even if I did send some great man into samadhi, then at most he would give a village or a part of his kingdom, neither of which I have the slightest desire for in my heart. Even if I were to wish for a village or a part of a kingdom for the sake of happiness, still when I close my eyes and think of Bhagvan's murti; that bliss cannot be found even in a kingdom consisting of the fourteen loks.
16.4 "Also, if there is as much bliss in ruling a kingdom as there is in worshipping Bhagvan, then why would great kings, such as Svayambhuv Manu, leave their kingdoms and go into the forests to perform tap? If there is as much bliss in women as there is in worshipping Bhagvan, then why would King Chitraketu abandon ten million women?
16.5 "Compared to the bliss of worshipping Bhagvan, the bliss of the fourteen loks is said to be like that of Narak. Therefore, a person whose happiness is based on the bliss of Bhagvan feels that the pleasures of all the vishays in the entire brahmand are like Narak. Even I feel that the bliss of worshipping Bhagvan is the only real bliss – everything else is full of misery. Therefore, while worshipping Bhagvan, if I encounter someone who is naturally drawn into satsang, then I encourage him; but there is no type of insistence in my heart. I only insist upon engaging in the worship of Bhagvan and keeping the company of bhaktas of Bhagvan. What I have disclosed before you is my inner belief."

The Seva Of A Bhakta Is Known As Bhakti
17.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Posh vad Amas [6th February 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed in the mansion facing the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sadhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
17.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked a question: "Each of the five gnan-indriyas and the five karma-indriyas have total knowledge of their respective vishays. Furthermore, both a person with gnan and a person without gnan behave in the same way through their indriyas; the indriyas of the person with gnan do not behave in a different way from those of the person without gnan. However, the person with gnan is said to have conquered the indriyas. How can this be so? That is the question."
17.3 Muktanand Swami replied, "It seems that a person conquers his indriyas when he attains nirvikalp samadhi."
17.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Even a person who has attained nirvikalp samadhi indulges in the panch vishays through the indriyas just like everyone else; so, how can he be said to have conquered his indriyas?"
17.5 Muktanand Swami made many attempts to answer the question, but he was unable to give a satisfactory explanation.
17.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The answer is that he realises that there is only misery in the panch-vishays ( shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh). He also realises that there are only kalyan-kari qualities in the svarup of Bhagvan. He even realises that by indulging in worldly vishays, the jeev is condemned to Narak, where he must suffer terrible miseries. Having realised this, he develops an intense hatred towards the panch-vishays. There is no way a person will have love towards something with which he has such hatred. A person who realises this, and then develops an extreme hatred in his mind towards the panch-vishays can be said to have conquered his indriyas. As a result of this, he spends the rest of his life offering bhakti to Bhagvan by listening to talks of Bhagvan, singing kirtans, and performing seva. However, unlike a vimukh, he does not become attached to the panch-vishays. Such a person is known to have conquered his indriyas."
17.7 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked another question: "Suppose there is a tyagi who has adopted the path of nivrutti. He realises himself to be the atma and does not believe his body to be his true svarup. Also, his physical behaviour is rather unusual and irregular. This man does not have any pride of his varna and ashram. The way in which he eats, drinks, rises, and sits is all rather unusual – it does not seem to match the norms of society. Such a tyagi does not stay in anyone's company; he is like a young, carefree deer, wandering alone in a forest. He cannot be bound by anything in any way.
17.8 "On the other hand, there is another tyagi who behaves in accordance with the path of pravrutti, despite also having adopted the path nivrutti. When he engages in pravrutti that brings out vicious natures, such as kam, krodh, lobh, moh, mad, matsar, asha, and trushna, it also causes a disturbance in his heart. So, is it appropriate for such a tyagi to continue following the path of pravrutti? If he does remain on the path of pravrutti, how could he remain undisturbed? If you say, 'If he follows the path of pravrutti by Bhagvan's agna then he will not become attached to anything', then a person can argue, 'If someone drinks bhang by Bhagvan's agna, does that mean he will not become delirious? Of course, he will become delirious'. Then, how can that tyagi follow the path of pravrutti and not become attached to anything? That is the question."
17.9 Hearing this, Nityanand Swami and Shuk Muni attempted to give an explanation, but were unable to give an accurate reply.
17.10 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The tyagi who abides by nivrutti dharma only and who behaves in an unusual way should be known as a person who has only atma-nishtha. On the other hand, the tyagi who has adopted nivrutti dharma but also offers bhakti to Bhagvan should vigilantly adopt the path of pravrutti related to Bhagvan and His bhaktas while staying within the niyams prescribed by Bhagvan. In fact, adopting the path of pravrutti in order to serve Bhagvan and His bhaktas is the very definition of bhakti.
17.11 "The tyagi who has adopted the path of nivrutti and who has only the virtue of atma- nishtha can never be equal to the tyagi who has adopted the path of pravrutti. This is because although he is also a tyagi who has adopted the path of nivrutti, he engages in pravrutti for the purpose of being able to serve Bhagvan and His bhaktas. Such a person should stay on the path of pravrutti while abiding by the niyams prescribed by Bhagvan. However, he should never do more than or do less than those niyams. While discarding vicious natures such as kam, krodh, lobh, moh, mad, matsar, asha, and trushna, he should follow the path of pravrutti for the purpose of serving Bhagvan and His bhaktas. As a result, he will never become attached to anything. Compared to the tyagi who has only atma- nishtha, this tyagi is far superior, and it is he who earns the grace of Bhagvan."

Fundamental Facts Of The Swaminarayan Sampraday
18.1 In the Samvat year 1882, after the sandhya arti on Maha sud 1 [7th February 1826], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed under the dome of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi- Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of the paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered on all four sides around Him.
18.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Seeing that you are all senior paramhans, I shall ask you a question: Which facts are essential for a satsangi to understand? If someone were to ask him, or if he were to experience a doubt in his own mind, then without knowing these facts, how would he be able to find the solution?"
18.3 Having asked the question, Maharaj Himself continued, "I shall answer the question myself. Firstly, a person should realise that our sampraday is the Uddhav Sampraday, and therefore, a person should know its customs.
18.4 "Secondly, a person should know the line of succession of our gurus. He should know that Ramanand Swami was the avatar of Uddhav himself; and in a dream, that same Ramanand Swami was initiated into the Vaishnav sect by Ramanuj-acharya in Shreerang-Kshetra. So, Ramanand Swami's guru was Ramanuj-acharya, and I am Ramanand Swami's shishya. A person should understand the succession of gurus in this way. In addition, he should understand the tradition of the Dharma-Kul that I have established.
18.5 "Thirdly, a person should know the authoritative shastras of our sampraday, the names of which are: Ved, Vyas Sutra, Shreemad Bhagvat Puran, Vishnu-Sahasranam from the Mahabharat, Bhagvad Geeta, Vidur-Niti, Vasudev Mahatmya from the Vishnu-Khand of the Skand Puran, and Yagnavalkya Smruti. A person should know these eight shastras.
18.6 "Fourthly, a person should know all the niyams which are prescribed for all satsangis.
18.7 "Fifthly, a person should understand Shree Krishna Bhagvan, our ishta-dev, and also the variety of the svarup of Shree Krishna Bhagvan due to varying locations, followers, and actions.
18.8 "In addition, the pratyaksha and the non- pratyaksha svarups of Shree Krishna Bhagvan should be understood. He is non- pratyaksha in the sense that Shree Krishna Bhagvan resides in Akshardham in the midst of Golok, which is beyond the darkness of Maya. He has two arms and is as luminous as millions and millions of suns, while He has a dark complexion. Radhikaji and Lakshmiji are beside Him, and He is served by parshads, such as Nand, Sunand, and Shreedama. He is the cause of creation, sustenance, and destruction of countless millions of brahmands. He reigns as the supreme ruler of everything. This Bhagvan sometimes assumes a svarup with four arms; sometimes, He assumes a svarup with eight arms; and He may even assume a svarup with a thousand arms. He also assumes all the svarups of the four avatars ( Vasudev, Sankarshan, Aniruddha, and Pradyumna); as well as the twenty-four avatars. He also takes birth through avatars such as Varah, Nrusinh, Vaman, Kapil-Dev, and Hayagriv, while He actually always possesses two arms. It is this same svarup that has been described in the Upanishads, the Sankhya shastras, the Yog shastras, and the Panch-Ratra. This is how Bhagvan's svarup is described as being non- pratyaksha.
18.9 "Furthermore, of all the acharyas that have lived, Vyasji is the greatest. Even Shankar-acharya cannot be said to be like Vyasji. In fact, nor can Ramanuj-acharya, nor can Madhva-acharya, nor can Nimbark, nor can Vishnu Swami, and nor can Vallabh-acharya. This is because those acharyas will only be accepted as respected in the world if they accept the greatness of Vyasji's words; but not otherwise. However, Vyasji does not need to rely upon anyone else to be respected. This is because Vyasji is the acharya of the Veds and is Himself an avatar of Bhagvan. Therefore, we should abide by Vyasji's teachings only.
18.10 "That same Vyasji, for the kalyan of the jeevs, separated the Veds into four parts, wrote the seventeen Purans, and the Mahabharat. Still, he felt in his mind, 'I have not been able to carefully explain the methods for the kalyan of the jeevs'. As a result, he did not feel satisfied in his mind. So, he wrote the Shreemad Bhagvat Puran, which is the essence of all the Veds, the Purans, the historical shastras, the Panch-Ratra, the Yog shastras, and the Sankhya shastras. In that Shreemad Bhagvat, He has described Shree Krishna Bhagvan as greater than all the other avatars, and that all the avatars originate from that same Shree Krishna Bhagvan.
18.11 "In the Gun-Vibhag chapter of the Shreemad Bhagvat, Shree Krishna Bhagvan says to Uddhav, 'I am nirgun, and whoever comes into my contact also becomes nirgun'. That is why all those who came into my contact with Shree Krishna Bhagvan – with whichever feeling – also became nirgun, regardless of whether it was a feeling of lust, hatred, fear, friendship, or love. Therefore, Shree Krishna Bhagvan Himself is nirgun. This is how Vyasji has described Shree Krishna Bhagvan. Also, Vyasji has established the following principle: 'Shree Krishna Bhagvan Himself is the Bhagvan who assumes all the avatars, and all other avatars are also Him'. If Shree Krishna Bhagvan is described as being merely the embodiment of pure sattva-gun instead of being described as nirgun, then a person has not grasped the context of the Shreemad Bhagvat and it results in a major misunderstanding. After all, the gopis did not realise Shree Krishna Bhagvan to be Bhagvan; their feeling of lust for Shree Krishna Bhagvan was their method of worship of Him. However, they still became nirgun. Then, how can Shree Krishna Bhagvan be described as being merely the embodiment of pure sattva-gun? Therefore, Shree Krishna Bhagvan is definitely nirgun. In addition, Shree Krishna Bhagvan Himself has said to Arjun: janma karma cha me divyam-evam yo vetti tattvataha tyaktva deham punar-janma naiti mam-eti sorjuna : He who thoroughly realises my birth and actions to be divya will not take another birth when he leaves his body. Instead, he will attain me.
18.12 "At the time of His birth, Shree Krishna Bhagvan showed Vasudev and Devki His svarup with four arms so that they would realise Him to be Bhagvan. He also showed Brahma many svarups with four arms; He showed Akrur the svarup of Shesh-Shayi Narayan; and He showed Himself in the Vishvarup form to Arjun. In this way, it is acceptable to make distinctions in the types of worship of Shree Krishna Bhagvan due to differences in His svarups. However, this true svarup is different.
18.13 "In Vraj, Shree Krishna Bhagvan was known as Bal-Mukund; He was also called Murli-Manohar, and Radha-Krishna; He used to take the cows and calves for grazing; He lifted Mount Govardhan; He played ras with the gopis; He went to Mathura and killed Kans; He pleased the Yadavs; He studied at the home of the brahman named Sandipani; He associated with Kubja; He stayed in Dvarka, where He married eight queens, such as Rukmani; He also wedded sixteen thousand women; while staying in Hastinapur, He protected the Pandavs from all the calamities which fell upon them; He saved Draupadi from humiliation; and He became Arjun's charioteer. In this way, there were many leelas of Shree Krishna Bhagvan due to differences in locations. However, from this, a person should not make distinctions in the types of worship of Shree Krishna Bhagvan's two-armed svarup. A person who does, should be known as a blasphemer of the guru and the guru's word.
18.14 "In fact, Shree Krishna Bhagvan has behaved in many different ways. He has eaten the leftovers of the cow-herds and has even played ras with the gopis. However, the bhaktas of Shree Krishna Bhagvan should not imitate His behaviour. Instead, they should behave according to the characteristics of a sadhu and abide by the dharma of their varna and ashram. They should offer bhakti to Him as prescribed by Shree Krishna Bhagvan in the eleventh skandh of the Shreemad Bhagvat, the Bhagvad Geeta, and the Vasudev Mahatmya. However, they should behave as Shree Krishna Bhagvan behaved. A person who does behave as Shree Krishna Bhagvan behaved is a vimukh, and is not my satsangi.
18.15 "Just as a person should not imitate the behaviour of our ishta-dev Shree Krishna Bhagvan, similarly, as I am your acharya, your guru, and your adviser, you should not imitate my physical behaviour. Instead, all of you should behave according to my agnas that I have prescribed for those in my sampraday; but no one should imitate my behaviour.
18.16 "All paramhans and all satsangis should learn these facts which I have told you. After understanding them, all should behave accordingly. Also, when speaking with others, you should tell them to behave similarly."
18.17 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj left for dinner. Upon hearing this talk, all the sadhus and satsangis understood that the non- pratyaksha svarup of Shree Krishna Bhagvan whom Shreeji Maharaj spoke of is none other than this Shreeji Maharaj, son of Bhakti and Dharma, and that no one is greater than Him. It is only He who is our ishta-dev, and it is only He who is our guru.

Becoming A Bhakta Of Bhagvan
19.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on the evening of Maha sud 2 [8th February 1826], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed in the eastern rup-choki of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
19.2 Then, after the sandhya arti had finished, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please listen, I wish to speak to all of you about Bhagvan. Whenever a jeev attains a human body in Bharat-Khand, Bhagvan's avatars or Bhagvan's sadhus will certainly also be present on earth at that time. If that jeev can recognise them, then he becomes a bhakta of Bhagvan.
19.3 "Once he has become a bhakta of Bhagvan, it would be improper for him to have love for anything except Bhagvan. This is because, compared to the bliss of the dham of Bhagvan, the pleasures of worldly vishays are like faeces. Only worms that live in the faeces feel that there is profound bliss – a human would realise faeces to be nothing but utter misery. Therefore, a person who has recognised Bhagvan becomes a parshad of Bhagvan. Then, he should not cease to be an attendant of Bhagvan by desiring to enjoy the pleasures of worldly vishays like worms in faeces.
19.4 "Also, whatever a bhakta of Bhagvan wishes for comes true. Therefore, he is extremely careless when he desires any object other than Bhagvan out of ignorance. That is why a bhakta of Bhagvan should consider the pleasures and delights of the fourteen loks to be like the faeces of a cow. He should have strong love only towards Bhagvan and His bhakta, by thought, word, and deed. He should believe, 'If a bhakta of Bhagvan has some desires remaining in him other than those of Bhagvan, he will still attain the status of Indra or will attain Brahm-Lok. However, unlike worldly people, he will certainly not pass through the cycle of births and deaths or go to Narak. If that is so, then how can a person describe the greatness of Bhagvan and the bliss enjoyed by a true bhakta of Bhagvan?' Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvan should maintain deep love only for Bhagvan."

Janak Raja's Understanding
20.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Maha sud 3 [10th February 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a square platform under the neem tree in the darbar of the mandir of Shree Lakshmi-Narayan in Vadtal. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Garlands of chameli flowers were hanging around His neck. In addition to this, a red umbrella made from fine, silken cloth had been placed above Him. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
20.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked the paramhans a question: "Kam evolves from rajo-gun, and krodh and lobh evolve from tamo-gun. So, which one spiritual activity totally uproots the seeds of kam, krodh, and lobh?
20.3 Shuk Muni replied, "The seeds of these vicious natures are burnt from a person's heart only when he attains nirvikalp samadhi and when he sees the atma."
20.4 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj raised a doubt: "Did not Shiv, Brahma, Shrungi Rushi, Parashar, and Narad have nirvikalp samadhi? All were overcome by kam. However, despite their attainment of nirvikalp samadhi, when the vruttis of their indriyas reverted outwards, they were overcome by the vicious natures, like kam, and krodh. For this reason, what you have said cannot be the answer to the question. In fact, just as a person with gnan remains undisturbed in nirvikalp samadhi, a person without gnan also remains undisturbed in sushupti. When the vruttis of the indriyas revert outwards, both are disturbed by kam and krodh. Therefore, there does not seem to be any distinction between the person with gnan and the person without gnan. Now, other paramhans may try to answer the question."
20.5 Then, Gopalanand Swami, Devanand Swami, Nityanand Swami, and Muktanand Swami collectively attempted to answer the question according to their understanding, but they could not give a precise response to Shreeji Maharaj's question.
20.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Janak Raja followed the path of pravrutti, and yet he was undisturbed. For example, when a female tyagi named Sulbha came into Janak Raja's court, He told Sulbha, 'Though you are trying to seduce my mind, by the grace of my guru Panch-Shikh Rushi, I have mastered the shastras of both Sankhya and Yog. So, even if half of my body is smeared with sandalwood paste and the other half is slashed with a sword, both would be the same to me. Even if my Mithila were to burn down, still nothing of mine would be burned. Therefore, even though I have adopted the path of pravrutti, I am still unaffected and undisturbed'. This is what Janak Raja said to Sulbha. Also, Janak Raja was said to be the guru of Shukji.
20.7 "Therefore, the answer to the question is as follows: A person's indriyas may be directed outwards and he may be on the path of pravrutti, but if he has a firm understanding in his heart, like that of Janak Raja , then he will in no way become disturbed by vicious natures, like kam, and krodh.
20.8 "After a person has thoroughly known that which needs to be known – this is true and this is false – he realises that except Bhagvan's svarup, all worldly objects are full of terrible miseries, and that they are all perishable. Also, he realises himself to be the atma, distinct from his body, his indriyas, and his antah-karan s. After this, there is no object that would be strong enough to seduce him. This is because he sees all worldly objects as worthless. So, even if all the indriyas of a person in whose heart such understanding has become firmly rooted were to extend outwards on the path of pravrutti, still he would not be disturbed by vicious natures, like kam, and krodh.
20.9 "The seeds of vicious natures, like kam, and krodh, in the heart of such a bhakta of Bhagvan will be destroyed, whether he is a tyagi or a grahastha. Also, of all the bhaktas of Bhagvan, he is the best Vaishnavs. So, being a tyagi or a grahastha is of no significance. Instead, a person whose understanding is greater should be known as being a greater bhakta than the rest.
20.10 "The mistake of those like Shiv and Brahma were mentioned only to illustrate that when they encountered unpleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang, even they were disturbed by vicious natures, regardless of whether they had deficiencies in their understanding or not. Therefore, even if a person has this understanding, he should never associate with any type of evil influence. This is the universal principle."


Shree Amdavad Prakaran

Amdavad – 1
Extraordinary Dhyan
1.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Maha vad 11 [4th March 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting facing west in the mandir of Shree Nar-Narayan in Amdavad. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Garlands of roses were hanging around His neck, bunches of roses had been placed upon His ears, and tassels of roses decorated His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas, from various places had gathered before Him.
1.2 In the sabha, Shreeji Maharaj sat in deep thought. He then opened His eyes, looked at the sabha, and said, "I wish to talk to all of you about a particular type of dhyan that has also been described in the Moksh-Dharma. I have seen many great people who have attained siddh-dasha through this type of dhyan. In fact, even in my experience, among the countless types of dhyan, there are none comparable to the particular type of dhyan that I wish to tell you about now. Just as a mantra or medicine is naturally extraordinary, the type of dhyan I wish to describe to you also has an intrinsically miraculous nature by which a person instantly attains siddh-dasha.
1.3 "Now, I shall describe that dhyan. A person should perform dhyan on the sun in the right eye and perform dhyan on the moon in the left eye. Then, while performing dhyan in this way, the sun and the moon begin to appear in the eyes exactly as they are in the sky. As a result, the right eye begins to heat up, and the left eye begins to cool down. Then, the sun should be envisioned in the left eye and the moon in the right eye. After visualising in this way, the sun, and the moon should be visualised within the hruday-akash. In addition, the svarup of his own jeev, the observer, should also be seen. He should also perform dhyan upon Bhagvan – who resides within the observer (within his own jeev). At that point, his body, which is full of worldly desires, is felt to rotate in the sky like a pulley mechanism used for drawing water from a well.
1.4 "Eventually, a person who performs dhyan in this way attains the darshan of Bhagvan's Vishvarup form, within which he also sees the system of the fourteen loks. That svarup is not seen as being extremely large; it is seen in the same way that Markandey Rushi saw the entire brahmand in the stomach of the child svarup of Bhagvan sleeping on the leaf of a banyan tree.
1.5 "Having performed dhyan in this way, a person is able to see everything that is described in the shastras. Then, all remaining nastik feelings within his jeevatma are resolved, and the jeev becomes extremely powerful. In addition, he develops a firm belief that whatever is stated in the shastras is true. The eight extraordinary powers become accessible to a person who performs this dhyan, and his vision reaches as far as the rays of the sun and moon. In this way, countless extraordinary powers appear before that person, but because he is a bhakta of Bhagvan, he does not accept any of those powers. Instead, he performs dhyan only on Bhagvan. As a result, the performer of this dhyan attains siddh-dasha like Narad, the Sanakadik, and Shukji. Therefore, there are countless varieties of dhyan, but only this form of dhyan grants instant siddh-dasha."
1.6 After Shreeji Maharaj concluded this description, Muktanand Swami asked, "Is this dhyan attained only by a person who practices the pranayam of ashtang-yog, or can it be attained by others as well?"
1.7 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "It does not matter whether a person practices pranayam or not. Only if he practices this dhyan and is an ekantik bhakta of Bhagvan can he perfect it. However, people are unable to walk this path. Therefore, for those who are eligible to perform this dhyan, there is no alternative method for instantly becoming siddh other than the method of dhyan that I have just described."

Performing Puja After Washing And Bathing The Best Bhakta Abandons Worldly Responsibilities 
2.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Fagan sud 11 [20th March 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a wooden bedstead on a square platform in front of the mandir of Shree Nar-Narayan in Amdavad. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chofal. He had also tied a pink feto around His head, with tassels of roses dangling from it. Also, two bunches of roses adorned His neck. In addition to this, bajubandh and gajara of roses had been tied around His arms. In this way, His entire body had been decorated with roses. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
2.2 Then, addressing all the paramhans, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I would like to ask you a question. Suppose there is a bhakta of Bhagvan who behaves above the influence of jagrat, svapna, and sushupti. He has shed the influence of polluted rajo-gun, tamo-gun, and sattva-gun, and acts within pure sattva-gun. That is how he worships Bhagvan. Another bhakta behaves under the influence of the three gun but he does have intense love for Bhagvan. Of these two bhaktas, who is better?"
2.3 Then, the sadhus replied, "The bhakta with love for Bhagvan is better."
2.4 Shreeji Maharaj then questioned, "Now, consider the following: One person performs puja of Bhagvan after washing, bathing, and becoming pure; and another performs puja in an impure state. Of these two, who is better?"
2.5 The munis replied, "The person who performs puja after becoming pure is better."
2.6 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj said, "You claim that the person who worships Bhagvan after overcoming mayik influences is inferior, and the person who expresses love for Bhagvan with mayik influences is superior. But, how is he superior?"
2.7 Since no one could answer the question, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Of the four types of bhaktas ( arta, jignasu, artharthi, and gnani) described in the Geeta, Shree Krishna Bhagvan had called the only bhaktas possessing gnan His own atma. Therefore, the person who becomes brahm-rup after having discarded mayik influences, and then worships Bhagvan, is the best bhakta.
2.8 "This is because nitya- pralay is the jeev's sushupti state. Nimit- pralay is Brahma's sushupti state. Prakrut- pralay is when all the entities that have evolved from Prakruti merge back into Prakruti. In atyantik- pralay, which is gnan- pralay, everything up to and including Prakruti is hidden by the light of Brahm. Furthermore, in nitya- pralay, all of the jeev's responsibilities are absorbed; and in prakrut- pralay, all of Purush's responsibilities are absorbed. However, when the creation process is initiated, all three are again engulfed by their respective responsibilities.
2.9 "However, a person who has overcome mayik influences by way of atyantik- pralay, also called gnan- pralay, is never engulfed by those responsibilities again. If at any time he does assume a physical body, then just like Bhagvan assumes a body by His own will, he also assumes a body of his own will; he does not assume a body due to Kal, karma, or Maya.
2.10 "Therefore, the person who worships Bhagvan after becoming brahm-rup is definitely superior. Only a person who is a faithful bhakta of Bhagvan and possesses the characteristics of an ekantik bhakta can understand this fact."

The Branch Of A Banyan Tree - The Upsham State
3.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Fagan vad 2 [25th March 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed on the platform facing the mandir of Shree Nar- Narayan in Amdavad. A pink pagh, decorated with garlands of roses and chameli flowers, adorned His head. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
3.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked the entire muni- mandal, "All jeevs are dependent upon the panch-vishays. Either they physically indulge in them, or if physical association is not possible, they think of them within the antah-karans – but the jeev is unable to remain for even a moment without thinking about or indulging in the panch-vishays.
3.3 "Now, take the example of a banyan tree. Everyone knows that the roots of a banyan tree keep the tree green. Even if all of its roots, except for a few minor roots, are uprooted, the banyan tree will still remain green. In the same way, a person may have outwardly abandoned the panch-vishays, but if thoughts of them still remain, then those thoughts become a cause of births and deaths. The question is how can these panch-vishays not become a cause of births and deaths for a bhakta of Bhagvan?"
3.4 Muktanand Swami attempted to answer the question, but was unable to offer a satisfactory reply.
3.5 So, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Here, I shall answer the question. When a bhakta thinks about the murti of Bhagvan while behaving as the atma – independent of the qualities of the three bodies, which are engulfed in maya – then by the power of those thoughts of Bhagvan, he behaves in a state of upsham. Then, due to the power of that upsham, the panch-vishays do not become a cause of births and deaths.
3.6 "Consider the following analogy: When rivers like the Mahi or the Sabarmati are in full flow between their two banks, even elephants, horses, and trees are all carried away; nothing is able to remain stationary. Similarly, for a person in the upsham state, regardless of how attractive the objects presented before the indriyas are, when he focuses his attention within, they are forgotten, just as those vishays seen in past lives are forgotten in this life. Such behaviour of a bhakta is known as upsham.
3.7 "Such upsham is indeed extremely important. Suppose an ignorant man and woman, who are engaged in worldly life and who have intense love for each other before marriage, are then married and made to stay awake and walk continuously for three days and nights. Then, when they are united, due to their fatigue, they will be incapable of enjoying the pleasure of each other's beauty or touch. Even if they embrace each other, they would sleep like logs tied together, but would not experience any enjoyment from the panch-vishays. So, if they have no awareness of the vishays due to upsham attained ignorance during sushupti, then how can the panch-vishays bind a person with siddh-dasha who attains the state of upsham by performing dhyan upon Bhagvan's murti? They certainly do not bind him. Therefore, the panch-vishays are not a cause of births and deaths for a person who has attained upsham."
3.8 Then, Nityanand Swami commented, "The method you have described for attaining the state of upsham (performing dhyan upon Bhagvan after atma- nishtha) is very difficult. Please tell us if there is another, easier method apart from that."
3.9 Shreeji Maharaj said, "A bhakta of Bhagvan who deeply understands the greatness of Bhagvan, and performs darshan of Bhagvan, and serves Him and His bhaktas with extremely intense shraddha, attains that upsham state.
3.10 "However, it appears to me that a servant with man will not be liked by anyone. To have a servant with man serve a person is like when even the rich survive by eating kodra during a famine; having a servant with man to serve a person is similar to this. The master is not as pleased with a servant with man as much as he is with a humble servant. Therefore, a person who does whatever pleases the master is a true servant."
3.11 Shuk Muni then asked, "How can a person without wisdom and understanding please his master?"
3.12 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Even though Mulji Brahm-Chari and Ratanji are not extremely intelligent, they have an intense yearning for kalyan. So, they do indeed know how to do whatever pleases Bhagvan.
3.13 "Also, currently, even the paramhans and the sankhya- yogi and karma-yogi satsangis do not behave in a way that pleases me, like the bhaktas of Ayodhya men and women. This is because the bhaktas of Ayodhya have totally dedicated their lives for satsang. Therefore, nobody knows how to please Bhagvan like the bhaktas of Ayodhya. Moreover, these bhaktas of Ayodhya are extremely trusting; a cunning person can cheat them. Therefore, if they wish to begin any activity, they should be allowed to do so only after consulting the senior paramhans and senior satsangi grahasthas. However, they should not be allowed to do that activity based on the word of a single person. In this way, the tyagis and grahastha satsangis should look after the bhaktas of Ayodhya. This is my agna."

The Avatar Of Bhagvan
4.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Fagan vad 3 [26th March 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow placed on a decorated bedstead upon a square platform facing the mandir of Shree Nar-Narayan in Amdavad. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A pink pagh had been tied around His head, and tassels of roses were dangling from that pagh. Bunches of roses had also been placed upon His ears. In addition to this, several garlands of roses were hanging around His neck, and bajubandh and gajara of roses had been tied around His arms. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
4.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said to the muni-mandal and the bhaktas, "Everyone, please listen to what I have to say. A person should first develop a firm belief of the svarup of Bhagvan. What is Bhagvan like? Well, by His own wish, He takes birth for the kalyan of the jeevs. However, having taken birth, He is still beyond birth. Despite having to die, Bhagvan is still beyond ageing and death. He is also niranjan, and He has no blemish of Maya. In addition, He possesses a definite murti and is svayam-prakash; He is Parbrahm, antaryami, the supporter of countless millions of brahmands; and He is also beyond Akshar. His assuming and discarding of a human body is merely an illusion – like the magic of a magician. Furthermore, He is the controller of the countless muktas, including Akshar. He is also the lord of all. That Shree Purushottam Narayan, after first taking birth from Dharma-Dev and Murti, performs tap in Badrikashram in the svarup of Nar-Narayan.
4.3 "That same Shree Nar-Narayan assumes the svarup of Matsya, Kurma, Varah, Vaman, Ram, and Krishna on the earth for the fulfilment of particular tasks. Then, using His own body, He helps other people eradicate their belief of being the body and accept the belief of being the svarup of brahm. In this way, He makes His body and the bodies of other people appear to be the same. For example, just as after a thorn is used to remove another thorn, both thorns are discarded, similarly, Bhagvan discards His body like other jeevs discard theirs. This event is explained in the Mahabharat through the story of Nrusinhji. When He wished to leave His body, Nrusinhji, through His antaryami powers, inspired Shiv within his heart to take the svarup of a sharabh. Then, both Nrusinhji and the sharabh fought a battle in which Nrusinhji died. Therefore, Bhagvan independently, by His own wish, accepts a human body and abandons that human body.
4.4 "After hearing the charitras of Rushabh- Dev being burnt in a forest fire, and Shree Krishna Bhagvan being killed by an arrow striking his foot, the minds of those with a nastik belief, and those who are not bhaktas of Bhagvan become confused. They then allege that Bhagvan too passes through birth and death just like themselves, and He receives a human body according to His karmas, and then leaves the human body by His karmas as well. They also declare that only when Bhagvan performs karmas that do not cause attachment will He be released of His karmas and attain kalyan.
4.5 "On the other hand, those who have an astik mind, and those who are bhaktas of Bhagvan, realise the understanding of the nastiks to be wrong. They know the body of Bhagvan to be eternal; and that the birth, childhood, youth, old age, and death of Bhagvan, as well as whatever other bodily qualities He may display, are merely an illusion. This is because Kal and Maya are not powerful enough to have any sort of influence on Bhagvan's body. In fact, all changes that do appear to occur in Bhagvan's body are all due to His extraordinary powers. Those who are bhaktas of Bhagvan are not misled by this; whereas the minds of those who are not bhaktas become confused, just like worldly people become confused on seeing a magician's acts. However, those who are aware of the magician's techniques are not confused. Similarly, Purushottam Shree Nar-Narayan also assumes many different bodies and discards them like the magician. Therefore, this Shree Nar-Narayan is the cause of all avatars.
4.6 "Those who assume death upon Shree Nar-Narayan will themselves have to undergo countless births. The suffering of passing through the cycle of 8.4 million different life-forms and the torments of Yampuri are indeed endless. Conversely, those who realise Shree Nar-Narayan to be beyond ageing and death will be released from their karmas and the consequent cycle of births and deaths in the 8.4 million life-forms. Therefore, all satsangis and sadhus of our Uddhav Sampraday should not assume death upon the murtis of Bhagvan – those that have occurred in the past, the current murti, or those that will occur in the future. This principle should be noted by all."
4.7 In this way, Shreeji Maharaj revealed Himself as the pratyaksha murti of Bhagvan. All who heard this talk strengthened their nishchay in Shreeji Maharaj in this same way.

Amdavad – 5
Dharma, Arth, Kam, And Moksh
5.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Fagan vad 4 [27th March 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow placed on a decorated bedstead on top of a square platform north of the mandir of Shree Nar-Narayan in Amdavad. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Around His neck was a large garland of roses, and tassels of flowers were hanging from His pagh. With His right hand, He was turning a mala made from tulsi beads. A sabha of senior munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
5.2 Then, Chhadidar Kuber Sinh asked, "Maharaj, what is the most extraordinary characteristic of Shree Purushottam Narayan?"
5.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "No one except Shree Purushottam Narayan can control the nadis and prans of innumerable beings and grant them instant samadhi; nor can anyone else influence hundreds of thousands of people by having them abide by niyams; and nor does anyone else have the power to control Akshar and the muktas. These are the extraordinary characteristics of Purushottam Narayan."
5.4 Then, Kuber Sinh asked a second question: "Maharaj, there are countless millions of brahmands. In this brahmand, the avatar of Bhagvan is present in Bharat-Khand, in Jambu-Dvip. But, please explain how Bhagvan gives kalyan to the countless beings of the other brahmands."
5.5 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The very Bhagvan that resides in this brahmand is also the lord of all. It is Bhagvan who assumes a body in each brahmand for the sake of the kalyan of countless beings. These beings seek His refuge and consequently attain the holy feet of Shree Purushottam Narayan in Akshardham. That is the answer to your question."
5.6 Kuber Sinh then asked again, "Maharaj, what please identify what satsangis should abandon and what they should accept."
5.7 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "They should abandon all desires for worldly objects. Instead, they should develop desires related to Bhagvan. If they do have desires for wealth, they should think, 'If we worship Bhagvan, we will attain gold coins, diamonds, rubies, jewels, and other invaluable things in the dham of Bhagvan'. However, in no way should they have desires for worldly objects. If they have lustful desires, they should think, 'If we look lustfully towards another woman, we will have to pass through the cycle of 8.4 million life-forms and suffer extensively. Even dogs and donkeys indulge in this, whereas I have attained the pratyaksha svarup form of Purushottam. It will be a great loss for me if He is displeased'. After thinking in this way, they should abandon such lustful desires and should desire happiness that is related to Bhagvan. If they have love for the relatives of the body, they should also abandon it. Instead, they should develop love towards the Bhagvan's sant. They should accept this much.
5.8 "On the other hand, satsangis should abandon the sense of 'I-ness' towards the body and develop an attitude of a das towards Bhagvan. If Bhagvan or His sant have become displeased in any way or have disapproved of a person, then he should discard all cruel feelings that he may have developed towards Bhagvan or His sant. Moreover, he should realise his own mistake and accept the gun of Bhagvan and His sant. In this way, a person should always think positively, but never think negatively. That is the answer to your question."
5.9 Then, Kuber Sinh asked another question: "Maharaj, please explain the nature of dharma, arth, kam, and moksh."
5.10 Shreeji Maharaj smiled gently and said, "The nature of arth is to accumulate wealth or to fulfil a person's aim of moksh. That is the nature of arth. The nature of dharma is to use that wealth in satsang for the purpose of dharma; but, not spend it for other purposes. That is the nature of dharma. The nature of kam is to have only one wife, to have physical relations with her only at the appropriate time, to reject all women in the world by regarding them as a mother, sister, or daughter. That is the nature of kam. Finally, the nature of moksh is to attentively follow all the niyams of satsang and keep unfaltering nishchay in Bhagvan. That is the nature of moksh. That is the answer to your question."
5.11 Shreeji Maharaj then retired to sleep.

Amdavad – 6
The Cause Of All Avatars
6.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Fagan vad 6 [29th March 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on top of a square platform facing the mandir of Shree Nar-Narayan in Amdavad. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Garlands of roses were placed around His neck, and tassels of chameli flowers were hanging from both sides of His pagh. Bunches of roses had been placed upon both of His ears. In addition to this, Shreeji Maharaj had taken a large bunch of roses in His hand and was gently rubbing it around His face. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
6.2 Then, after the evening arti, Kuber Sinh asked Shreeji Maharaj a question: "Maharaj, please reveal how nishchay in Bhagvan that a person has firmly established in his heart would never falter."
6.3 Shreeji Maharaj first commented, "Everyone should hear the answer to this question, so please listen attentively." He then said, "If a person knows the greatness of the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan, then his belief never falters. I shall now explain that greatness.
6.4 "All the avatars of Bhagvan emerge from the very Bhagvan that is present in this satsang. He is the cause of all the avatars and is the antaryami of all. It is Bhagvan in Akshardham, who is radiant, full of countless powers, and eternally has a svarup. He is also the lord of all the lords of the countless brahmands; He is even the cause of Akshar-Brahm. When that Bhagvan takes birth on earth and adopts the behaviour of Rushabh-Dev, He is known as Rushabh- Dev; when He accepts the divine ways of the avatar of Ram, He is known as Ram- Chandra; and when He performs the charitras of Shree Krishna, He is known as Shree Krishna. In this way, whichever behaviour of the avatars can be seen in Bhagvan, it should be understood that all the previous avatars of Bhagvan have emerged from Him, and that He is the ultimate cause of them all. If a person understands this, his belief never falters. But, if he does not understand this, his belief may falter. That is the answer to your question."
6.5 Shreeji Maharaj then added, "Furthermore, that same Shree Krishna Bhagvan took birth as Shree Nar-Narayan from Dharma and Bhakti. Therefore, realising this Shree Nar-Narayan to be my svarup, I have installed His murti for the first time here in Shree-Nagar. Therefore, no one should perceive even the slightest difference between Shree Nar-Narayan and myself. It is He who is the dweller of Akshardham."
6.6 Hearing Shreeji Maharaj say this, Kuber-Sinh asked further, "Maharaj, what is that Akshardham like? Please describe it and the bhaktas of Bhagvan that reside there."
6.7 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "It is Akshardham which has become the dham of Shree Purushottam Narayan to dwell in. That Akshardham in the svarup of the dham of Bhagvan is eternal in comparison to all the other Akshardhams (the muktas who have become like Akshar- Brahm). Within that Akshardham, there are several types of palaces. Each palace has various types of decorative balconies and terraces. There are also many different types of fountains and many different types of gardens. The gardens contain innumerable flowers of innumerable species, and each one is radiant. It is so beautiful that it cannot be compared to any other dham. It is also called Golok. In addition, its splendour is countless times more than the divine riches of countless other dhams.
6.8 "That dham is also limitless. Just as there is no limit to akash, regardless of the direction in which a person looks, similarly, there is no limit to Akshardham. Whether a person looks above, below, or in the four directions, there is no boundary to the dham of Bhagvan. This is because it is endless. If a person were to try to reach its end, he would realise that it is endless. Such is the vastness of Akshardham.
6.9 "Also, the objects within Akshardham are all divya and composed of chaitanya. Countless parshads, who are also radiant and have a divya svarup, reside in that dham. They are forever eager for the seva of Bhagvan, who is the antaryami of all life-forms. It is the same lord of that dham – the lord of Akshar and the muktas, Parbrahm Purushottam – who is present here in this satsang. Only a person who has such nishchay attains Akshardham."

Amdavad – 7
Divine Characteristics Of Shreeji Maharaj
7.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Fagan vad 7 [30th March 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was having the Vasudev Mahatmya read on the medi above the gate of the mandir of Shree Nar-Narayan in Amdavad. Then, in the evening, He got up and sat facing east on a decorated bedstead under the neem tree near the gate. Around His head, He had tied a pink pagh, and tassels of roses had been inserted into the pagh. He was also wearing garlands of roses. In addition to this, He was wearing a white surval and had covered Himself with a thin, white chofal. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
7.2 Then, Pragji Davé asked, "Maharaj, by what means can a person's mind become firmly fixed on you so that it does not become adulterous by straying elsewhere?"
7.3 Shreeji Maharaj began by saying, "Please listen as I answer your question." He then continued, "By realising the greatness of Bhagvan, a person's mind becomes fixed on Him. Now, I shall explain how that greatness should be understood.
7.4 "I had previously asked Ramanand Swami at Ladha Brahman's house in Piplana, 'Are you truly Bhagvan, or are you merely called Bhagvan?' Ramanand Swami did not reply then. Later, in Samvat 1869, I had fallen ill. During my illness, I went to Kshir-Sagar where Shesh-Shayi Narayan rests upon Shesh, and I saw Ramanand Swami there. He was wearing a white dhoti and had covered himself with a white pachhedi. I also saw many others sitting near the holy feet of Shesh-Shayi Narayan. I asked Narayan, 'Who is this Ramanand Swami?' Narayan replied, 'He is a knower of Brahm'. After He said this, Ramanand Swami merged into the body of Narayan, and I then returned to my physical body.
7.5 "Then, when I performed antar-drashti, I saw the source of the divine sound of pranav. While I was looking at it, Nandishvar, the bull, approached me. I mounted upon it and went to Shiv in Kailas. There, Garud arrived. So, I mounted upon it and began to travel to Vaikunth and Akshardham. However, as Garud was unable to fly to Akshardham, I went alone to the dham of Shree Purushottam Narayan, which is beyond everything. There, I saw that it was I who was Purushottam; I did not see anyone important, apart from myself. In this way, I travelled to these places, and then finally returned to my body.
7.6 "Then, when I looked within again, I realised that I am the creator, sustainer, and destroyer of all the brahmands. In those countless brahmands, it is by my divine light that countless Shivs, countless Brahmas, countless Kailas, countless Vaikunths, Golok, Akshardham, as well as countless millions of other loks, are radiant.
7.7 "What am I like? Well, if I were to shake the earth with the toe of my foot, the worlds of countless brahmands would begin to shake. It is also by my divine light that the sun, the moon, and the stars are radiant. So, if a person develops the belief of my svarup in this way, his mind becomes fixed on me – Bhagvan – and would never stray anywhere else. Moreover, I will grant my supreme dham to all who come to my refuge and understand this. In addition, I will make them antaryami, and powerful enough to create, sustain, and destroy brahmands. However, after receiving such powers, a person should not think, 'I alone my great', and neglect and murti of Shree Nar-Narayan. Instead, a person should realise 'It is by compassion of Shree Nar-Narayan that I have attained such greatness'."
7.8 In this way, Shreeji Maharaj answered the question.

Amdavad – 8
The Prayshchit For Anger
8.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Fagan vad 8 [31st March 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was serving food to the sadhus in their residential hall, north of the mandir of Shree Nar-Narayan in Amdavad. He had tied a beautiful, white pagh around His head and was wearing a white khes. He has also placed a khes over His left shoulder and had tied one of its ends around His waist. Also, a large garland of roses was hanging around His neck.
8.2 While serving ladus to the sadhus, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A sadhu should abandon anger in all respects. What is anger like? Well, it destroys all noble qualities such as gnan, the performance of tap, and the chanting of the name of Bhagvan.
8.3 "Now, I shall identify the motives from which anger arises. Anger arises when sadhus are engaged in a question-answer discussion amongst themselves, or if there is an argumentative discussion. It can also arise from the giving and taking of particular objects, or when lecturing someone, or when a person tries to maintain prejudice towards his shishya. Also, anger can arise when a person is insulted, out of jealousy, over where to sit or not to sit, or even because of the unequal distribution of Bhagvan's prasad. In this way, there are many reasons for anger to arise.
8.4 "If a senior sadhu or a junior sadhu becomes angry, he should first perform dandvat pranam to whomever he has expressed his anger upon, and then please that person by speaking pleasant words to him in a pleading, gentle, and sincere tone. This is my agna.
8.5 "If anyone else, due to a cruel intellect, has an offensive thought towards a sadhu, he should confess and voice his offensive thought by saying, 'Maharaj, I have thought offensively of you'. Then, in order to be forgiven for that thought, he should fold his hands and pray for forgiveness.
8.6 "If a sadhu becomes angry with a grahastha bhakta, then he should verbally pray and bow down to him from a seated position; but he should not perform dandvat pranam before him. If sankhya- yogi women become angry amongst themselves or on karma- yogi women, they too should pray verbally and bow down from a seated position. On the other hand, sankhya-yogi men should do as the sadhus do if they become angry upon anyone.
8.7 "In general, whenever we become angry with someone, we should realise that person to be a bhakta of our lord, Shree Nar-Narayan, and instantly abandon our arrogance, bow down to Him, and pray. However, a person should never maintain an outward perspective by believing, 'I am senior and better than him; whereas he is not senior but a mere junior'. A person should not entertain such a feeling. In fact, even our ishta-dev, Shree Nar-Narayan, does not keep any arrogance or anger; so as His followers and the members of this Uddhav Sampraday, we should abandon all forms of anger and arrogance.
8.8 "Shree Nar-Narayan will be greatly pleased upon anyone who performs the prayshchit that I have prescribed for becoming angry. As a result, that person's antah- karans will be purified, and all of his vicious natures, such as kam, krodh, abhiman, lobh, man, and matsar, will be destroyed. Conversely, a person who does not perform prayshchit for becoming angry should be thought of as a snake, not as a bhakta of Bhagvan."


Shree Ashlali Prakaran

Ashlali – 1
The Three Types Of Bhaktas
1.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Chaitra sud 2 [9th April 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj left Amdavad with great festivity and reached Ashlali in the evening. There, He was accommodated in a mango grove north of the village and was seated on a platform. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Also, He was wearing beautiful garlands of flowers around His neck, and tassels of flowers were hanging from His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
1.2 Shreeji Maharaj then said to Muktanand Swami, Brahmanand Swami, and all the other sadhus, "Please listen, I wish to say something. Whoever incompletely realises the nature of Bhagvan suffers a great loss. That person cannot experience the true bliss of Purushottam Bhagvan – who we also call Shree Krishna, Shree Vasudev, Shree Nar-Narayan, Parbrahm, and Shree Narayan – nor can he become an ekantik bhakta. Therefore, a person should strengthen his gnan of Bhagvan by great association with an ekantik bhakta of Bhagvan who has gnan. This is because, without the true gnan of Bhagvan even the prajapatis and other creators of the universe have to repeatedly take birth along with the creation, and then ultimately merge back into Maya. However, they do not attain Akshardham, the dham of Shree Purushottam Bhagvan. The reason for this is a flaw in their understanding."
1.3 Then, all the munis asked, "Maharaj, please explain this flaw in their understanding."
1.4 Shreeji Maharaj said, "Very well. Please listen as I explain their flaws. First of all, they consider the strength of their own actions but not the strength of a person's refuge in Bhagvan to be instrumental in their kalyan. Secondly, they do not realise that becoming akshar-rup and serving Shree Purushottam Nar-Narayan is in itself kalyan. Their third mistake is that they believe the innumerable avatars of Bhagvan, such as Ram and Krishna, to be a part of Bhagvan. Fourthly, at the time of a previous death, they had a thought in their minds, 'How are the brahmands created? It would be good to see for once'. Seeing their desire, Bhagvan engaged them in the creation of the brahmands. They will only become brahm-rup and attain the dham of Bhagvan when they realise true gnan by great association with an ekantik bhakta of Bhagvan; and only then will they become eternally happy. Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvan should desire nothing but the seva of Bhagvan."
1.5 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "There are three types of bhaktas; and they can be recognised by their characteristics: A person who worships Bhagvan with the intention of earning powers to create the world is known as aishvaryarthi. He is a kanishth bhakta. A person who worships Bhagvan only to experience the atma is known as a kaivalyarthi. He is a madhyam bhakta. However, a person who has a constant the singular determination for the seva of the pratyaksha svarup of Purushottam Bhagvan is known as a bhagvat-nishtarthi. He is an uttam bhakta and best bhakta of all. As all of us have the belief of the pratyaksha svarup of Shree Nar-Narayan, we are all undoubtedly the best."
1.6 All who had gathered in the sabha were overjoyed hearing these words of Shreeji Maharaj.


Shree Jetalpur Prakaran

Jetalpur – 1
The Dvait Philosophy
1.1 In the Samvat year 1882, about an hour-and-a-half after sunrise on Chaitra sud 3 [10th April 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed under an asopalav tree in the mansion in Jetalpur. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Around His neck, He was wearing several garlands of guldavadi flowers, tassels of dolariya flowers were dangling from His pagh, and two karnikar flowers had been placed upon both of His ears. Also, He was playing with a beautiful lemon in His hands. A sabha of sadhus, as well as satsangi men and women from various places, had gathered before Him.
1.2 Then, addressing the entire sabha, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "Everyone in this world accepts some philosophy or other. There are two major doctrines: One is the Dvait philosophy and the other is the Advait philosophy. Please explain which philosophy should be accepted by a mumukshu."
1.3 Then, Purushottam Bhatt said in reply, "Maharaj, in the Advait philosophy, by believing their atma to be Bhagvan, people behave as they please. As a result of this, they fall from the path of kalyan. Therefore, a mumukshu should accept the Dvait philosophy."
1.4 Shreeji Maharaj then raised a doubt. He questioned, "According to the Dvait philosophy, jeev, ishvar, and Maya are satya. But, as long as Maya persists, how can the jeev attain kalyan?"
1.5 Purushottam Bhatt replied, "A person attains kalyan by performing pure karmas."
1.6 Again, Shreeji Maharaj raised a doubt: "The two types of karmas, nivrutti and pravrutti, become merged into Maya in the form of sushupti. What is that state of sushupti like? Well, just as no one is capable of conquering Mount Loka-Lok, similarly, no jeev is capable of conquering the sushupti. Above that, is Maya in its state of equilibrium, and it is extremely vast. No jeev can conquer it. Therefore, the means to go beyond Maya is as follows: When the jeev comes into contact with the pratyaksha svarup of Shree Purushottam Bhagvan – who is beyond Maya, and who is the destroyer of Maya and all karmas – or His sant who has attained Bhagvan, then by accepting their refuge, the jeev can go beyond Maya."
1.7 After delivering this talk, Shreeji Maharaj went up into the mansion for His meal. After dinner, He returned and sat on a decorated bedstead under the asopalav tree. Then, looking lovingly at all the sadhus and bhaktas, He said, "In the beginning, when no one honours a person, imagine what his nature is like. Then, when a hundred people begin to follow him, his pride becomes of a different type. Also, when one thousand people, or ten thousand people, or ten million people follow him, his pride becomes of a different type altogether. Then, if he becomes like Brahma, or Shiv, or Indra, and if he is wise, he would realise, 'My greatness is not due to this status'. What is it due to? Well, greatness is due to the atma, and due to association with a sant. This is because even though those like Brahma, Shiv, and Indra are all great, they still crave for the dust from the feet of a sant.
1.8 "So, where does the greatness of a sant lie? Allow me to explain. The greatness of a sant is not due to wealth, or objects, or any kingdom; his greatness is due to his bhakti and upasana of Bhagvan. Also, the sant has atma- nishtha. It is due to these qualities that he is great.
1.9 "If a person cannot realise this, then he should develop a belief within his atma that he should be deeply attached to a sant who has attained the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan, and he should believe only that sant to be his own self. However, a person may doubt, 'How is the master-servant relationship maintained?' Well, take the example of Galav Raja. He wanted to perform a sacrifice for which he specifically required white horses with black ears. It so happened that those black-eared horses were at the home of Varun. But, since that region was beyond his reach, he called upon Garud. Then, having mounted Garud, he went there and brought back the horses. So, does this mean that Galav Raja's seva towards Garud diminished? No, it did not diminish. Similarly, the purpose of being deeply attached to a sant, who is a knower of Brahm, is that he has the ability of passing through the eight barriers ( jad prakruti). That is the reason for being deeply attached to such a sant."
1.10 Shreeji Maharaj then added that all should remember this principle, as it is the very life of everyone.

Jetalpur – 2
The Characteristics Of A Yati
2.1 In the Samvat year 1882, in the evening of Chaitra sud 4 [11th April 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed in the middle of the courtyard of the mandir of Shree Baldevji in Jetalpur. He was dressed entirely in white clothes, and tassels of dolariya flowers decorated His pagh. Also, He had a handkerchief in His left hand and was turning a mala of tulsi beads with His right hand. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
2.2 Then, Brahmanand Swami bowed before Shreeji Maharaj and asked, "Maharaj, please reveal who can be called yati?"
2.3 Shreeji Maharaj said, "A person who firmly follows brahm-charya and has conquered all of his indriyas should be known as a yati; a person who is like Hanumanji and Lakshmanji should be known as a yati. When Hanumanji went to Lanka in search of Sitaji on Ramchandraji's instruction, he looked at the faces of all the women in Lanka in order to recognise her. As he continued looking, he thought, 'This is not Jankiji... This one is not Jankiji'. Then, while he was thinking this, he saw Mandodari and thought, 'Could this be Jankiji?' But, then concluded in his mind, 'Because of her separation from Ramchandraji, Jankiji's body would never be so plump, and she would never be able to sleep so soundly'. With this thought in mind, Hanumanji turned back.
2.4 "Then, he doubted in his mind, 'I am a yati; but, could a flaw have developed in me by seeing all these women?' But, then he reconciled to himself, 'How can there be any flaw in me? It is because of Ramchandraji's instruction to find Sitaji that I had to look at all these women'. He also thought, 'By Ramchandraji's grace, no disturbance has arisen in my indriyas and in my vrutti'. Thinking this, he wandered everywhere to look for Sitaji. In this way, like Hanumanji, a person whose antah-karans remains pure despite being faced by such vicious influences is called a yati.
2.5 "Moreover, while searching for Sitaji in the forest after she was abducted, Ramchandraji and Lakshmanji came to the place where Sugriv was seated on the Fatak Shila. They informed Sugriv, 'We have come here because Jankiji has been abducted. So, if you know of her whereabouts, please tell us'. Sugriv replied, 'Maharaj, I did hear the cries, "O Ram! O Ram!" coming from the sky. Also, some items of jewellery, which are tied in a piece of cloth, were dropped from above. I have kept them with me'. Then, Ramchandraji requested, 'Please bring them here so that we can see them'. Ramchandraji took the pieces of jewellery from Sugriv and showed them to Lakshmanji. First, He showed jewellery worn on the ears, and bracelets worn on the arms, but Lakshmanji did not recognise any of these. Then, He showed some anklets. Lakshmanji immediately exclaimed, 'Maharaj, I have never seen Jankiji's body. In fact, except for her feet, I have not seen any other part of Jankiji's body. The only reason I have been able to recognize the anklets is because whenever I used to go and bow at her feet every evening, I would see her ankles'. In this way, despite the fact that for fourteen years Lakshmanji was in their service, with the exception of Jankiji's feet, he had never intentionally seen her body. Such a person should be known as a yati."
2.6 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj commented, "This Brahmanand Swami is also like that."
2.7 In this way, as the sabha was listening, Shreeji Maharaj greatly praised Brahmanand Swami as being a yati.
2.8 Then, Shreeji Maharaj went to the outskirts of the village. There, He sat on a decorated bedstead that had been placed on top of a low, broad platform at the site where the yagnas had been performed. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
2.9 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please begin a question-answer discussion."
2.10 Then, ashji-Bhai Patel asked, "Maharaj, what is the nature of the jeev? Please reveal it to me as it is."
2.11 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The jeev is achhedhya, abhedhya, avinashi, chetan, and the size of an atom. You may also ask, 'Where does the jeev reside?' Well, it resides in the hruday- akash, and while staying there it performs different actions. From there, when it wants to see, it does so through the eyes; when it wants to hear sounds, it does so through the ears; it smells all types of smells through the nose; it tastes through the tongue; and through the skin, it experiences the pleasures of all feelings. In addition, it produces thoughts through the man, it thinks through the chitt, and it makes decisions through the buddhi. In this way, through the ten indriyas and the four antah-karans, it indulges in all the vishays. It pervades the entire body from head to toe, yet is distinct from it. This is the nature of the jeev. It is due to the grace of the pratyaksha svarup of Purushottam that a bhakta is able to perceive the jeev as it actually is. On the other hand, others cannot even begin to realise the nature of the jeev."
2.12 Having answered the question in this way and pleasing everyone, Shreeji Maharaj bid "Jay Sachidanand" to the sabha and retired to the mansion to sleep.

Jetalpur – 3
Overcoming Vasna
3.1 In the Samvat year 1882, in the early morning of Chaitra sud 5 [12th April 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj arrived in the garden on the western side of the mansion, the place of His residence, in Jetalpur. Under a large bordi tree within the garden, He was sitting facing east on a decorated bedstead, with a large, cylindrical pillow, that had been placed on a platform. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. He was also wearing garlands of champa, borsali, and guldavadi flowers around His neck, and tassels of chameli and dolariya flowers were hanging from His pagh. Bunches of hajari flowers had been placed upon His ears. In addition to this, He was playing with a pomegranate and a lemon with both hands. Muktanand Swami, Brahmanand Swami, and other munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him in a sabha.
3.2 Shreeji Maharaj first thought for a while, and then said, "Everyone please listen, as I wish to speak to you. For bhaktas of Bhagvan, there is nothing worse than having impure desires. This is because bhaktas who have such impure desires, even if they stay near me, cannot be happy. In fact, before engaging in the worship of Bhagvan, they asked, 'Maharaj, please keep us near you'. However, because they did not eradicate their impure desires, they are miserable."
3.3 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, how are those impure desires eradicated?"
3.4 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The method for eradicating impure desires is as follows: Firstly, whenever a person entertains a thought which disobeys the rules of dharma that have been laid down by me, or whenever he thinks cruelly of a sadhu or a grahastha, he should repeatedly chant 'Nar-Narayan, Swaminarayan' aloud. Secondly, he should offer to Bhagvan the nine types of bhakti coupled with knowledge of His greatness and the observance of dharma. As a result, Bhagvan resides in his heart and destroys the impure desires. In fact, just as Bhagvan freed the elephant from the crocodile's mouth, in the same way, this method that I have just revealed to you will eradicate your impure desires.
3.5 "Now, I shall tell you another method which will benefit all of you, so please listen. A person should never intentionally disobey the rules of dharma related to his vartmans. If a person does so unknowingly, he should immediately perform prayshchit for disobeying the vartmans.
3.6 "In addition, a person should realise his own self to be the witness; 'I am the atma, which is full of chaitanya; it is beyond all thoughts and reason. This body, which is accompanied by the mind, is not actually my true svarup'.
3.7 "Furthermore, if Bhagvan smiles at someone, or if Bhagvan calls someone, or if He performs any other sort of action, he should never develop hatred towards Him. A person should absorb this form of understanding. However, someone may feel, 'I have worshipped Maharaj a lot, and I have also performed a great deal of seva; still, Maharaj does not talk to me. Instead, He talks to others a lot. So, I might as well worship Bhagvan while sitting at home'. In this way, he develops hatred towards Bhagvan. In that case, I could also believe, 'What does this person have to do with me?' As a result, that person's future would be uncertain. However, I myself do not look at anyone's avgun. In fact, my nature is such that I always look only at people's gun.
3.8 "Now, I shall tell you how that bhakta should perceive gun and eradicate avgun. If he thinks, 'What was I like before I came into satsang? Well, I experienced kal, karma, birth, death, and the cycle of births and deaths. So, how can I develop hatred towards Bhagvan who has freed me from all of that, who has made me fearless, and who has helped me progress by bestowing noble qualities upon me? How can I ignore His wishes and do as I please?' A bhakta becomes happy only when he stops hating Bhagvan by thinking in this way.
3.9 "In fact, with the body, nothing is greater than to do as Bhagvan likes. That in itself is bhakti. In fact, only by doing this does a person attain Bhagvan. That is why vicious natures, such as man, irshya, kam, krodh, and lobh, are all obstacles on the path of kalyan and should be discarded.
3.10 "Of those vicious natures, man is absolutely the worst of all. Just look, a person who has a minor flaw in any other vartman still manages to survive in satsang, whereas those who had man have never been able to survive. Therefore, sadhus must never allow any lapse in the observance of the vartmans and remaining without man. Be extremely vigilant. Believe your own self to be distinct from your body. Offer bhakti to Shree Purushottam attentively and thoroughly. Constantly engage in bhajan and smaran of Bhagvan; its bliss will equal the bliss of actually having the darshan of Bhagvan.
3.11 "Also, in our satsang, a person who is educated in the shastras is not necessarily great. Who should be considered great? Well, a person who considers all fourteen loks to be as insignificant as a blade of grass, due to vairagya; a persons who has firm belief of Bhagvan as He is, just as he has firm attachment to his body; and a person who is oblivious to the world in the jagrat state just as he is oblivious to the world in the state of sushupti sleep – such a person is great in our satsang."

Jetalpur – 4
Seva Of A Bhakta
4.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on the Chaitra sud 6 [13th April 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress, and leaning on a large, cylindrical pillow, that had been placed in the south-facing balcony of the mansion in Jetalpur. He was wearing a white pagh, adorned with a bunch of small flowers, on His head, and He had covered Himself with a pachhedi of white flowers. He was wearing a white khes with a border of silver threads. In addition to this, His entire body had been smeared with sandalwood paste mixed with saffron. Also, garlands of guldavadi flowers were placed around His neck. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
4.2 Then, addressing the entire sabha, Shreeji Maharaj said, "In this lok, the jeev attains kalyan only by the following means; nishchay in the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan, His darshan, and His constant remembrance. After all, it is said in the Shreemad Bhagvat that even those who insulted Bhagvan, such as Kans, Shishupal, and Dantvakra, attained kalyan since all of them had constant remembrance of Bhagvan. Therefore, kalyan is attained by constantly remembering Bhagvan; and since all of you possess such remembrance, your kalyan is assured.
4.3 "Having said that, you should still follow all the rules of dharma prescribed by me for as long as you are conscious of your bodies. You may claim, 'If a person has attained Bhagvan and constantly remembers Him, why does he need to observe vartman?' In reply to that, consider the difference between a person who firmly observes the vartman and a person who is slacking in his observance. Allow me to explain that difference to you. Even though both remember Bhagvan, the person who does not follow niyams can only earn kalyan for himself, but he cannot help other jeevs attain kalyan. Also, he does not become an ekantik bhakta, nor does he attain the nirgun dham of Bhagvan. Even though he does not have to undergo births and deaths, he cannot stay in the satsang.
4.4 "However, all of you are the best type of bhaktas. In fact, sadhus such as yourselves, who observe niyams, are of a totally different category. For that reason, whoever feeds you sincerely will earn the rewards of performing millions of sacrifices and will ultimately attain kalyan; and whoever touches your feet will be freed of their sins committed in millions of past lives. Anyone who kindly offers you clothes will also attain ultimate kalyan. The rivers and lakes into which you dip your feet become like places of pilgrimage, and any tree that you have sat under or eaten fruits of will also definitely benefit. If someone devoutly performs your darshan, or is someone devoutly bows before you, then all of his sins are destroyed. Moreover, whomever you talk to about Bhagvan and whomever you inspire to follow niyams related to dharma will attain kalyan. All the actions of sadhus like yourselves, who observe niyams, lead to moksh. This is because you have the firm refuge of the pratyaksha svarup of Shree Nar-Narayan Rushi. That Shree Nar-Narayan Rushi is always present in your sabha.
4.5 "You may claim, 'If we have a firm refuge of Bhagvan, why do mayik qualities still pervade us?' Then, let me say that it takes me no time at all to eradicate the shad-urmi (six physical and emotional feelings) and the mayik qualities from all of you. In fact, it would take me no time to enable all of you to recall your countless previous lives and to be able to perform the creation, sustenance, and destruction, of countless brahmands. Nevertheless, I have kept you like this and have suppressed your powers because it is my wish to do so, and to allow you to attain the bliss of the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan. What is more, all of you have currently attained Shree Purushottam who is pratyaksha in the svarup of Shree Nar-Narayan Rushi. Therefore, abandon all doubts and happily engage in worship." Saying this, Shreeji Maharaj became silent.
4.6 Then, ashji-Bhai asked a question: "Maharaj, how is it that a person attains kalyan by keeping hatred towards Bhagvan? Please tell us."
4.7 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Once Drupad Raja wished to have his daughter, Draupadi, married. So that she could select a bridegroom, he arranged a grand function in which he invited all the kings. Dron-acharya also came, as did the Pandavs. Then, all the kings took turns to try and pierce the fish, but none were able to do so. Then, Yudhishthir said, 'I will pierce the fish'. Having said this, Yudhishthir took aim. Dron-acharya asked him, 'Can you see this sabha?' Yudhishthir replied, 'Yes, I can see it'. Again, Dron-acharya asked him, 'Can you see your body?' Yudhishthir replied, 'Yes, I can see it'. Then, Dron-acharya said, 'You will not be able to pierce the fish'. In this way, four of the brothers were unable to pierce the fish. Then, Arjun stepped forward. He picked up his bow and took aim. Dron-acharya asked him, 'Can you see this sabha?' Arjun replied, 'No, I cannot see the sabha, and I cannot even see the fish. Instead, I only see the bird attached to the fish'. Hearing this, Dron-acharya said, 'Focus on its head'. Arjun adjusted his aim and said, 'Now I do not see even the bird; I see only its head'. Finally, Dron-acharya said, 'Now take your shot'. Arjun then pierced the fish's head. In this way, if all of a person's vruttis are focused on the svarup of Bhagvan, then he can attain kalyan even with a feeling of hatred towards Bhagvan.
4.8 "For example, when the vruttis of those like Shishupal and Kans became completely engrossed in Shree Krishna, they attained kalyan. But, if a person does not know how to hate Bhagvan in this way then he is sent to Narak. Instead, it is much easier to engage in the bhakti of Bhagvan. However, a person who worships Bhagvan with such a cruel intellect will always be called demonic, and cannot be called a bhakta.
4.9 "Therefore, if a person wants to abandon the evil practices of the demons and join the ranks of Dhruv, Prahlad, Narad, and the Sanakadik, then engaging in the worship of Bhagvan by offering bhakti is far better."
4.10 Having heard Shreeji Maharaj speak in this way, everyone in the sabha experienced profound bliss.

Jetalpur – 5
The Wish Of Bhagvan
5.1 In the Samvat year 1882, approximately four-and-a-half hours after sunset on Chaitra sud 7 [14th April 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a wooden bedstead facing north in the courtyard south of the palace in Jetalpur. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. He had tied a pagh made from a thin, white cloth around His head. He had also covered Himself with a chadar, and was wearing a white dhoti. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
5.2 After thinking for a moment, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Everyone please pay attention; today I wish to talk to you about things as they really are. Specifically, there is nothing greater than worshipping Bhagvan. This is because everything happens according to the wish of Bhagvan. In fact, at this moment, even the wishes of this sabha can be fulfilled. By the grace of Shree Nar-Narayan, even my wish can be fulfilled. Allow me to elaborate on this.
5.3 "Whatever I wish in my mind is fulfilled in this world. If I wish, 'May he attain a kingdom', then he will attain a kingdom. If I wish, 'May he lose his kingdom', then his kingdom will be lost. If I wish, 'Let there be this much rainfall here at his moment', then it will definitely rain here; and if I wish, 'Let there be no rainfall here', then it will not rain here. Also if I wish, 'May he attain wealth', then he does so; and if I wish, 'May she conceive a son', then she mothers a son; and if I wish, 'May she not have a son', then she definitely does not. If I wish, 'May he contract a disease', then he will contract a disease; and if I wish, 'May he not contract a disease', then he will not contract a disease. So, when I wish for something, it actually happens that way.
5.4 "Then, you will argue that a satsangi still has to endure joy and pain – he contracts diseases, he sometimes loses all of his wealth and luxuries, and despite working extremely hard all his life, he still remains poor. Well, the explanation for all of his efforts not earning rewards is that it occurs in direct proportion to his slackness in engaging in the worship of Bhagvan. Bhagvan definitely wishes to assist him. In fact, if His own bhakta is to face the pain of a shuli, Bhagvan will reduce that pain by having him pricked by a mere thorn instead. As far as I am concerned, I feel, 'If a satsangi is to suffer the pain of a scorpion sting, may I suffer that pain a thousand times instead, but a bhakta should be relieved of that pain and remain happy'. This is the vardan I had requested from Ramanand Swami. That is why I pray, 'May good be bestowed upon all'.
5.5 "Also, I am always trying to keep the vrutti of people's minds fixed on Bhagvan. This is because I know everything about the past, the present, and the future. In fact, while sitting here, I know everything that happens; even when I was in my mother's womb, I knew everything; and even before I came into my mother's womb, I knew everything. This is because I am Bhagvan – Shree Nar-Narayan Rushi. Even if a person who has committed extremely great sins comes and accepts my refuge and abides by the niyams, then in his last moments, I will grant him my darshan and take him to Bhagvan's Akshardham.
5.6 "Presently, the lord of Akshardham, Shree Purushottam, being born of Dharma-Dev and Murti-Devi, takes birth in Badrikashram and performs tap in the svarup of Shree Nar- Narayan Rushi. It is to destroy the beliefs of the hypocrites, to destroy any traditions of adharma and nurture the traditions of dharma, and to increase bhakti coupled with dharma, gnan, and vairagya on this earth in this Kali- Yug that Shree Nar-Narayan Rushi was born to Dharma-Dev and Bhakti in the svarup of Narayan-Muni – who is presently seated in the sabha."
5.7 By saying this, Shreeji Maharaj filled His bhaktas with joy.
5.8 Continuing, He said, "The only purpose behind my repeatedly mentioning the predominance of Shree Nar-Narayan Dev is because that same Shree Nar-Narayan, who is Shree Krishna Purushottam and who resides in Akshardham, Himself sits daily in this sabha. This is why I speak of His predominance. So, realising my svarup, I have spent hundreds of thousands of rupees on constructing a shikhar-bandh mandir in Amdavad. That is why I first installed the murtis of Shree Nar- Narayan in that mandir. That Shree Nar-Narayan is the lord of countless brahmands. Of these, He is especially the lord of this Bharat-Khand. Those people in Bharat-Khand who ignore this pratyaksha svarup of Shree Nar- Narayan by worshipping other devs are like adulterous women who leave their husbands and become attached to other lovers. Even the Shreemad Bhagvat mentions that Shree Nar- Narayan is the lord of this Bharat-Khand.
5.9 "Furthermore, it is for the kalyan of the jeevs that I have taken birth on earth along with the sadhus. Therefore, if you abide by my words, I will take all of you to the dham from which I have come. So, you should also realise, 'We have already attained kalyan'. Furthermore, if you keep firm faith in me and do as I say, then even if you were to suffer extreme suffering, or even if you were to face the distress of seven consecutive famines, I will protect you from them. Even if you were made to suffer miseries from which there seems to be no way out, I will still protect you – but only if you thoroughly follow the dharma of my satsang, and only if you continue practising satsang. However, if you do not, you will suffer terrible miseries, and I will have nothing to do with you.
5.10 "This time, I have left no deficiency in any matter whatsoever. Just look, I have performed several yagnas in the village of Jetalpur. I have also been visiting here for so many years; I must have bathed in this lake along with my sadhus thousands of times; I have must have visited each home in this village of Jetalpur a hundred times, and I have also taken meals in every home. In this way, I have made this village and its outskirts even more sacred than Vrundavan."
5.11 As Maharaj was saying this, a large ball of light appeared in the sky, and then split into three distinct balls. They then hovered about the mansion for a while and then disappeared.
5.12 Seeing this phenomenon, everyone asked, "Maharaj, what was that?"
5.13 Shreeji Maharaj revealed, "Everyday, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiv come for my darshan and the darshan of this sabha of sadhus. But today, by the wish of Bhagvan, you have been able to see them along with their vimans."


GADHADa III
Shree Gadhada Antya Prakaran

Gadhada III – 1
The Shikshapatri
1.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on Vaishakh vad 11 [1st June 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed upon a beautifully coloured, decorated cot. The bedstead rested on the high veranda outside the west-facing rooms in the courtyard of the mandir of Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Beautiful tassels of mogra flowers decorated the large, white pagh that was tied around His head. Also, a garland of mogra flowers was hanging around His neck, and a string of flowers decorated His wrists. A sabha of munis, as well haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
1.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked the paramhans, "What is the understanding of a bhakta who experiences no obstacles in his bhakti towards Bhagvan, despite facing unpleasant circumstances?"
1.3 The paramhans replied according to their understanding, but they were unable to provide a precise answer.
1.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A person who worships Bhagvan needs firm vairagya, and atma- nishtha. If vairagya is lacking, then when he obtains desired objects, he will also develop love for those objects in the same way that he has love for Bhagvan. If atma- nishtha is lacking, then when the body experiences pain or pleasure, that bhakta's vruttis become disturbed. Then, he develops love for anything he considers to be full of happiness, and hates anything he considers to be full of misery. In this way, his mind becomes polluted. Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvan needs extremely firm atma-nishtha as well as extremely firm vairagya.
1.5 "This is because, by vairagya, all worldly forms except for Bhagvan's murti are proven false; and through atma- nishtha, worldly pleasures and miseries are proven false. A person who does not have the atma-nishtha and vairagya, even though he has attained nirvikalp samadhi, experiences happiness and peace only while he remains in samadhi. But, when he comes out of samadhi, he becomes attached to pleasurable object upon seeing them, as Narayan-Das did."
1.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A bhakta of Bhagvan either has the strength of gnan or the strength of love towards Bhagvan. Of these, a person who has the strength of gnan understands the greatness of Bhagvan and cannot stay without Bhagvan even for a moment. For example, Jhina-Bhai, Dev-Ram, and Prabha-Shankar have the strength of gnan. Such bhaktas who understand the greatness of Bhagvan should be known as having the strength of gnan. A bhakta who has love for Bhagvan, like the gopis of Vraj, should be known as having the strength of love.
1.7 "Of these, a person who has the strength of gnan realises Bhagvan as being antaryami and believes, 'Bhagvan does not make judgements based on what He hears from others. Instead, Bhagvan recognises a bhakta's strengths and speaks to him accordingly, but He does not act based on the advice of others'. Conversely, a person who believes, 'Bhagvan lectures me based on someone else's words, even though I am not at fault', has no gnan of Bhagvan.
1.8 "Even in worldly life we notice that a person who has selfish motives of gaining something from another will never see the other person's faults. This is because his love is based on self-interest. Similarly, if a person has the self-interest that Bhagvan will free him from the fear of births and deaths, then he will never perceive faults in Bhagvan. But, a person who perceives faults in Bhagvan by thinking, 'Bhagvan changes His opinion based on the prompting of others', has neither the strength of gnan nor the strength of love."
1.9 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj said to the senior paramhans, "Please reveal which of these two is your strength."
1.10 All the paramhans replied, "We have the strength of gnan."
1.11 Then, Shreeji Maharaj continued, "A person who has the strength of love will do anything for his loved one, even that which is not fit to be done. For example, in the world, thieves have love for their wives and children. However, when they go to steal, they kill other people and pass on the money to their own family. In reality, that thief is quite cruel, but since he has love for his own family, he is not cruel towards them. Similarly, a person who has love for Bhagvan and His bhaktas can never become angry at or jealous of Bhagvan or His bhaktas, and in no way does he perceive faults to them. A person who has such love can be said to have the strength of love. A person with neither the strength of gnan nor the strength of love is said to be fickle and unpredictable."
1.12 Having delivered this talk, Shreeji Maharaj returned to His residence.
1.13 On the evening of that same day, Shreeji Maharaj was seated on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow placed on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. He was also wearing a garland of mogra flowers around His neck. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some sadhus were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a dukad and saroda.
1.14 When the sadhus had finished singing, Shreeji Maharaj addressed the sabha: "The Shikshapatri which I have written should be read daily by all of my followers – tyagi sadhus and brahm-charis, as well as all male and female grahasthas. Those who do not know how to read should listen to it daily; and those who do not have the facility to listen to it should worship it daily. I have stated this in the Shikshapatri itself. A person should do upvas on the day he fails to do any of the three. This is my agna."
1.15 Then, everyone promised to follow this agna of Shreeji Maharaj by saying, "O Maharaj, we will do as you have said."
1.16 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj became extremely pleased. He embraced all the sadhus and brahm- charis and imprinted His holy footprints on the chests of all the satsangis.

Gadhada III – 2
Understanding Bhagvan's Greatness
2.1 In the Samvat year 1882, on the evening of Jyeshth sud 6 [11th June 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a low, wooden seat in the courtyard of the mandir or Shree Vasudev-Narayan in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white chadar. He had also tied a black-bordered, white pagh around His head, and tassels of mogra flowers had been inserted in the pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
2.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj posed a question: "A person sees that the world is perishable and that the chaitanya separates from the body and leaves it; however, the predominance of the world does not diminish from his heart. Despite thoroughly believing Bhagvan to be an ocean of bliss, his mind still does not focus on Bhagvan. Also, satsang does not become predominant in his heart and he cannot eradicate love for wealth, women, and other pleasures of the world. What can be the reason for this?"
2.3 Then, Muktanand Swami replied, "The person lacks vairagya. As a result, he cannot eradicate the predominance of the world from his heart, and nor can he develop love for Bhagvan."
2.4 Shreeji Maharaj then clarified, "It is true that there is a deficiency in vairagya, but it appears to me that the strength which forms as a person practices satsang, remains as it is forever; a different strength does not develop. By practicing satsang, that strength may be nourished, but the strength itself remains unchanged. Whenever a person's strength is being formed, his mind becomes disturbed in the process of formation. Just as the mind of an extremely lustful person is disoriented by lust, and the mind of an extremely angry person is disoriented by anger, and the mind of an extremely greedy person is disoriented by greed, similarly, a person's mind becomes disoriented in the process of developing his strength. Then, during the disturbance, whichever strength develops is the strength that remains. Therefore, a person who is wise should realise his own strength. When a person is disturbed by the influence of vicious natures, such as lust or anger, if he thinks about his own strength, the influence of the vicious natures is lessened.
2.5 "In addition, just as a grahastha feels regretful if he experiences lustful thoughts on seeing his attractive mother, sister, or daughter, similarly, a person should feel regretful when objects other than satsang become predominant in his heart. If a person does not feel similarly regretful on entertaining thoughts for indecent objects, then satsang does not remain predominant in his heart.
2.6 "In fact, the reward of all spiritual activities is satsang. In the eleventh skandh of the Shreemad Bhagvat, Shree Krishna Bhagvan says to Uddhav, 'I am not as pleased by ashtang-yog, thoughts of sankhya, scriptural study, tap, tyag, yog, yagna, and vrats, as I am pleased by satsang'. In fact, it appears to me that all sanskars a person has gathered from previous lives have been attained through association with a sat-purush. Even today, those who obtain sanskars do so through association with a sat-purush. A person who has attained the association of such a sat-purush, but is still unable to understand matters as they really are should be known to have an extremely dull intellect.
2.7 "As for me, I consider this sabha of satsangis to be far greater than the sabhas in Shvet- Dvip, Golok, Vaikunth, and Badrikashram; and I see all of these bhaktas as being extremely luminous. I take oath on this sabha of sadhus that there is not even the slightest lie in this matter. Why do I have to take oath in this way? Well, it is because not everyone understands such divinity, nor can they see it; that is why I have to take an oath.
2.8 "Therefore, even after attaining this satsang – which is rare for even Brahma – affection for objects other than Bhagvan still remains. This is because the person has not developed as firm a belief for the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan as he has for the non- pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan. That is why the Shrutis state, 'If a person develops belief in his guru – who is the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan – in the same way that he has belief in the non-pratyaksha devs, then as a result, he attains all the purusharths (dharma, arth, kam, and moksh) which are described as attainable'. In fact, when he attains the company of such a sant, he has attained He who was to be attained after death, while still alive; he has attained that which is called moksh or kalyan, while being alive.
2.9 "What I have just explained to you may appear to be simple, but in reality, it is extremely subtle. A person who is currently behaving in this way will understand that this is extremely subtle; but others will not even be able to understand it. That is how subtle it is."
2.10 After delivering this talk, Shreeji Maharaj bid "Jay Sachidanand" to everyone and then returned to His residence. 

Gadhada III – 3
Compassion And Love
3.1 In the Samvat year 1883, on Ashadh vad 1 [20th July 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was at His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. On that day, Harji Thakkar invited Shreeji Maharaj to sanctify his house. Shreeji Maharaj sat on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms. Harji Thakkar then performed puja of Shreeji Maharaj with sandalwood paste mixed with saffron. In this way, Shreeji Maharaj sat facing east and was dressed entirely in white clothes. Garlands of mogra flowers were hanging around His neck, gajara of mogra flowers were tied around both arms, and tassels of mogra flowers beautifully decorated His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
3.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked the entire sadhu- mandal, "Compassion and love reside instinctively in the heart of a bhakta of Bhagvan. Of the two, the nature of love is like honey; it sticks everywhere. The nature of compassion is that a person feels compassion towards everything. When Bharatji felt compassion for a deer, he had to take birth from the womb of a deer in his next life. Moreover, a person who is compassionate certainly develops love towards those he has compassion for.
3.3 "There are two methods for eradicating compassion and love: atma-nishtha and vairagya. Of these, atma-nishtha is such that nothing else can penetrate it. The nature of vairagya is that it shows all objects to be perishable. Therefore, through atma-nishtha and vairagya, compassion and affection are destroyed. In addition, the influences of the sthul, sukshma, and karan bodies are destroyed, and then only brahm-satta remains. But then, does a bhakta have compassion and love for Bhagvan and His bhaktas? Or does he not? That is the question."
3.4 Muktanand Swami, Shuk Muni, Nityanand Swami, and other paramhans answered according to the extent of their understanding. However, none could give a satisfactory reply to Shreeji Maharaj's question.
3.5 So, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Allow me to answer. The answer is that by gnan and vairagya, the chaitanya is freed from the mayik influences of the three bodies, the three mental states, and the three gun of Maya. It is then pure, and not the slightest trace of mayik influence remains. For example, consider the analogy of an oil lamp's flame. Only when a wick-holder, some oil, and a wick unite can the flame of an oil lamp be seen and recognised. But, when the combination of these three components is broken, the flame can no longer be seen by anyone, nor can it be recognised by anyone. Therefore, only when those components are combined is it seen and recognised. Similarly, when all the mayik influences are overcome by gnan and vairagya, the jeevatma remains as pure brahm-satta.
3.6 "Now, the jeevatma is invisible to the mind and speech, and it is not perceivable by any of the indriyas. However, with time, if it attains the knowledge of Bhagvan by associating with a pure sampraday, and it fully understands the greatness of Bhagvan and His bhaktas, then it is freed from all mayik influences. Then, that jeevatma also becomes brahm-rup. However, compassion and love for Bhagvan and His bhaktas still remains forever. To carry the analogy of the oil lamp further, when the combination of its components is broken, its flame remains within the air, where it cannot be perceived by any of the indriyas. However, the fragrance or foul smell that had pervaded that flame is not destroyed. Even though the air is more superior to the flame, it still becomes pervaded by fragrant or foul smells. Likewise, by gnan and vairagya, the jeevatma is freed from mayik influences, but the impression of satsang is not lost. Even though it becomes brahm-rup, like Narad, the Sanakadik, and Shukji, it behaves with intense compassion and love for Bhagvan and His bhaktas. The following verses illustrate this: parinishthitopi nairgunya uttama-shloka-leelaya gruheeta-cheta rajarshe akhyanam yad-adheetavan : O King (Parikshit)! Despite being perfectly poised in the nirgun state, having been attracted by the leelas of Bhagvan, I (Shukdevji) studied the Shreemad Bhagvat. harer-gunakshipta-matir-bhagavan badarayanihi adhyagan-mahad-akhyanam nityam vishnu vishnu-jana-priyaha : Honourable (Shukdevji) – son of Vyas, to whom bhaktas of Vishnu are very dear – was attracted by the gun of Bhagvan, and therefore constantly studied the great Shreemad Bhagvat. atmaramash-cha-munayo... : Despite being engaged in the atma and having overcome all improper natures, the munis still offer selfless bhakti to Bhagvan because He possesses such divya qualities. prayena Munayo rajan... : O King [Parikshit]! Although the munis had no need for the rules of moral conduct and had attained the nirgun state, they still engaged themselves in praising the glory of Bhagvan. "The Geeta also states: brahma-bhootaha prasannatma na shochati na kankshati samaha sarveshu bhooteshu mad-bhaktim labhate param : A person, who has become brahm-rup remains joyful, grieves nothing, desires nothing, behaves equally with all beings and attains my supreme bhakti.
3.7 "In this way, many verses promote the view that bhaktas of Bhagvan who have shed mayik influences and have become brahm-rup by gnan and vairagya, still have compassion and love for Bhagvan and His bhaktas. On the other hand, a person who is not a bhakta of Bhagvan, but has overcome mayik influences by atma-nishtha and vairagya alone and behaves as the atma, has been influenced by kusang during the process of realising Bhagvan, who has only atma-nishtha and do not have upasana of Bhagvan. As a result, he does not develop compassion and love for bhaktas of Bhagvan. Just as a foul smell lingers in the air and in fire, similarly, the impressions of kusang, which cannot be overcome by any means, lingers within him.
3.8 "For example, Ashvatthama was brahm-rup, but he was influenced by kusang. Therefore, he did not develop compassion or love for Shree Krishna Bhagvan or His bhaktas, the Pandavs. Similarly, the impressions of kusang do not disappear in a person who has only knowledge of the atma, even though he becomes brahm-rup; nor does he develop compassion and love for Bhagvan and His bhaktas. However, for a bhakta of Bhagvan, even though mayik influences are overcome, intense compassion and love for Bhagvan and His bhaktas increase. But, in no way are compassion and love ever lost; they always remain."
3.9 After delivering this talk, Shreeji Maharaj bid "Jay Sachidanand" to everyone and then returned to His residence.

Gadhada III – 4
Badhitanu Vrutti
4.1 In the Samvat year 1883, on Shravan sud 3 [6th August 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting facing north on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed on the veranda outside the medi of His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
4.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Even though a bhakta of Bhagvan may possess gnan and vairagya, and even if by the force of a thought process the bhakta has overcome affection for mayik objects that cause him bondage, until he attains nirvikalp samadhi, badhitanu vrutti still remains within.
4.3 "Until a bhakta of Bhagvan attains nirvikalp samadhi – even though he may possess gnan and vairagya, and by the force of a thought process has overcome affection for mayik objects that cause him bondage – badhitanu vrutti remains within him. Due to this, he doubts, 'Maybe attachment for my mother, father, wife, children, wealth, relatives, body, or property still remains!' He remains fearful in this way. For example, a brave warrior, even though he has killed all of his enemies, still occasionally becomes frightened by even those dead enemies; even if he sees them in his dreams, he becomes frightened. Similarly, due to badhitanu vrutti, even a bhakta possessing gnan is afraid of the bondage of worldly objects that he has proved false from within and from which he has severed all affection. At some time, if he remembers the money he possessed, or his wife or other objects, he becomes fearful in his mind and thinks, 'What if they cause bondage?' In this way, the recalling of objects that have been falsified from within is called badhitanu vrutti.
4.4 "Badhitanu vrutti is overcome when nirvikalp samadhi is attained. Then, that person becomes oblivious of eating and drinking, day and night, pain and pleasure. But, when he withdraws from nirvikalp samadhi and enters savikalp samadhi, badhitanu vrutti still remains. As a result of the influence of that badhitanu vrutti, when that bhakta contracts a fever or is at the moment of death, he sometimes recalls other objects besides Bhagvan. At that time, he may babble meaninglessly; he may even say words like, 'Mother! Father!' Hearing this, a person who does not understand the nature of badhitanu vrutti, will perceive faults in that bhakta by thinking, 'He was called a bhakta of Bhagvan; so, why does he speak like this at the time of death?' Such faults are perceived without knowing the nature of badhitanu vrutti.
4.5 "In the world many sinful people die with full consciousness. Also, a soldier or a Rajput who has injured his body may die while being fully conscious. That being so, will a vimukh who dies with full consciousness still attain kalyan, despite being a vimukh? Of course not; he will certainly be sent to Narak. Conversely, regardless of whether a bhakta of Bhagvan dies while engaged in the chanting of Bhagvan's name, or in a disturbed state due to the influence of badhitanu vrutti, bhakta still reaches the holy feet of Bhagvan."
4.6 On the evening of that same day, Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the medi of His residence. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sadhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places had gathered before Him.
4.7 Shreeji Maharaj then asked the senior paramhans, "Please describe how the jeev, which resides within the body, is present in one location, and how it pervades the entire body."
4.8 The paramhans answered according to their understanding, but none were able to satisfactorily answer Shreeji Maharaj's question.
4.9 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "In the body, just as food is transformed into semen, similarly, in the heart, the five bhuts are transformed into a disc of flesh, within which the jeev resides. The jeev clings to this disc of flesh like a torch made of rags that is set alight after being immersed in oil. Also, just as fire pervades an iron nail, similarly, the jeev actually resides in the disc of flesh, and by consciousness pervades the entire body. Therefore, regardless of where pain is felt in the body, it is the jeev itself that feels the pain; so, the jeev cannot be said to be separate from the pleasures and pains of the body.
4.10 "However, some may argue, 'The jeev is luminous, whereas the disc of flesh and the body have no light. So, how can they be said to have combined?' The answer to this is that just as without the combination of oil, a wick-holder and a wick, a flame cannot hover in space on its own, similarly, without associating with the disc of flesh the jeev cannot remain alone. Just as fire – which is distinct from the container, the oil and the wick – cannot be destroyed by breaking just the container, in the same way, the jeev does not die with the death of the body even though it pervades the disc of flesh and the body. Although the jeev does experience pleasure and pain along with the body, it is not perishable like the body. So, the jeev is indestructible and luminous, and it also pervades the body.
4.11 "Furthermore, if an oil lamp is placed at one location in a mandir, its flame predominantly pervades the wick; and secondarily, it also pervades the entire building. In the same way, the jeev also predominantly resides in and pervades the disc of flesh that is a product of the five bhuts; and secondarily, it resides in and pervades the entire body. Moreover, Bhagvan resides within the jeev as a witness."

Gadhada III – 5
Bhakti Coupled With The Knowledge Of Bhagvan's Greatness 
5.1 In the Samvat year 1883, on Bhadarva sud 11 [12th September 1826], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. He was also wearing a garland of mogra flowers around His neck. Tassels of mogra flowers decorated His pagh, and gajara of mogra flowers were tied around His arms. A sabha of the munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
5.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Someone please ask a question."
5.3 So, Muktanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, of the various types of bhakti offered to Bhagvan, which type of bhakti does not encounter any obstacles, and which type does encounter obstacles?"
5.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "In the third skandh of the Shreemad Bhagvat, within the Kapil Geeta, Devhuti says to Kapilji, yan-namadheya-shravananu-keertanad-yat-prahvanad-yat-smarana-dapi kvachit shvadopi sadyaha savanaya kalpate katham punas-te bhagavan-nu darshanat : If even a 'shvapach' (a vile person who eats dog-meat) becomes immediately suitable for performing yagnas (perfectly purified) by merely hearing and repeating the name of Bhagvan, by bowing to Bhagvan, and by remembering Bhagvan, then what can be said of your darshan? aho bata shavpachoto gareeyan yaj-jiha-vagre vartate nama tubhyam tepus-tapas-te juhuvuhu sasnur-arya bhrama-nuchur-nama grunanti ye te : How amazing! Even a 'shvapach' (a vile person who eats dog-meat) becomes great if your name is on the tip of his tongue (he chants Bhagvan's name). Those who chant your name are the ones who have performed all tap, performed all yagnas, bathed in the sacred waters of all the places of pilgrimage, and studied all the Veds; they indeed are the aryas (the noble ones). "The greatness of Bhagvan is described in these two verses. Also, Kapilji describes his own greatness to Devhuti: mad-bhayad-vati vato-yam suryas-tapati mad-bhagyat varshateendro dahatyagnir-mrutyush-charati mad-bhayat : It is by fear of me that the Vayu (wind) blows, Surya (sun) shines, Indra (clouds) rains, Agni (fire) burns, and Yam (death) devours the living.
5.5 "A person who has bhakti for Bhagvan coupled with such knowledge of His greatness encounters no obstacles in any form. On the other hand, a person who offers bhakti without realising the greatness of Bhagvan and who perceives worldly characteristics in Him, does encounter obstacles."
5.6 Muktanand Swami then asked, "By what means can such bhakti coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness be developed?"
5.7 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Bhakti coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness arises in a person's heart by serving and associating with renowned sadhus like Shukji and the Sanakadik."
5.8 Then, Shuk Muni asked, "One bhakta has perfect nishchay in Bhagvan, and disturbances such as kam, krodh, lobh, and moh do not arise in his heart. A second bhakta has perfect nishchay in Bhagvan, but disturbances such as kam, krodh, lobh, and moh do arise in his heart. When these two types of bhaktas leave their bodies, do they attain the same level of bliss in the dham of Bhagvan, or do they attain different levels of bliss?"
5.9 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a bhakta of Bhagvan whose nishchay is perfect and who is not disturbed by inner enemies, but desires anything other than the pratyaksha svarup of Shree Krishna Bhagvan, then even if he is a great tyagi, and has firm vairagya and intense atma-nishtha, he will attain a lower level of bliss. As for the other bhakta, even though he also has perfect nishchay in Bhagvan, when inner enemies cause disturbances within, he feels guilt within his heart. But, except for the pratyaksha svarup of Shree Krishna Bhagvan, he wishes for no other object. Then, even if he has only a slight amount of atma-nishtha and vairagya, such a bhakta still attains profound bliss in the dham of Bhagvan after leaving his body.
5.10 "This is because the first bhakta superficially appears to be a tyagi and nishkam. However, he does not have wish for the murti of Bhagvan, but instead has desires for the darshan of the atma and the four types of mukti. Therefore, he is called a sakam bhakta. In the higher loks, he will certainly attain less bliss. Conversely, the second bhakta superficially appears to be a sakam bhakta, but inwardly, that bhakta wishes for nothing except the murti of Bhagvan. If a desire for pleasures other than the murti of Bhagvan arises, he feels intense guilt in his mind. Therefore, he is called a nishkam bhakta. When such a bhakta leaves his body, he attains profound bliss, becomes a parshad of Bhagvan and develops intense love for the murti of Shree Krishna Bhagvan."

Gadhada III – 6
The Friendship Between The Mind And The Jeev
6.1 In the Samvat year 1883, on Bhadarva vad 5 [21st September 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
6.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj looked compassionately at all the bhaktas and said, "If a bhakta of Bhagvan engages in delivering kathas, singing kirtans, listening to talks of Bhagvan, and the rest of the nine types of bhakti with jealousy towards other bhaktas, then Bhagvan is not very pleased by that bhakti. But, if a person discards his jealousy and then offers bhakti only for his own kalyan, and not to display to other people, then Bhagvan is pleased by that bhakti. Therefore, a person who wants to please Bhagvan should not offer bhakti to please other people or out of jealousy for someone, but should do so only for his own kalyan.
6.3 "While offering bhakti to Bhagvan, if a person commits a mistake, he should not blame someone else for that fault. It is the very nature of all people that when they are at fault, they claim, 'I made a mistake because someone else misled me; but I am not really at fault'. A person who says this is a fool. After all, others may say, 'Go and jump into a well?' Then, by such words, should a person really jump into a well? Of course not. Therefore, the fault lies only in the person who makes the mistake, but he blames others.
6.4 "Similarly, to blame the indriyas and antah-karans is the foolishness of the jeev. In reality, the jeev and the mind are close mutual friends. Their friendship is like the friendship between milk and water. When milk and water are mixed and heated on a fire, water settles below the milk and it burns, but it does not allow the milk to burn. To save the water, the milk overflows and extinguishes the fire. Such is their friendship. The jeev and the mind have a similarly close friendship. So, the mind never has thoughts of things that the jeev does not like. Only when the jeev likes something does the mind attempt to persuade the jeev. How does it attempt to persuade it? Well, when the jeev is performing dhyan upon Bhagvan, the mind suggests, 'You should also perform dhyan on some female bhakta Bhagvan'. The mind then makes the jeev think of all of her features. Then, it forms indecent thoughts about her just as it forms indecent thoughts about other women.
6.5 "But, if the bhakta's jeev is extremely pure, he will not accept the arguments of the mind, and instead, he will feel intense sorrow. Therefore, the mind will never entertain such thoughts again. Conversely, if his jeev is polluted and sinful, it will accept the arguments of the mind. Then, by making the bhakta repeatedly think of indecent thoughts, the mind will make him fall from the path of kalyan. For this reason, a true mumukshu develops intense hatred for the talks of adharma, which are against the path of kalyan, regardless of whether they are suggested by his own mind or by some other person. Then, his own mind or the other person will not reappear in an attempt to persuade him.
6.6 "Furthermore, because the mind is a friend of the jeev, it will never entertain thoughts which the jeev does not like. So, when indecent thoughts are formed in the mind, if the jeev becomes extremely furious with it, such thoughts will never arise in the mind again. Therefore, when indecent thoughts repeatedly arise in the mind, the bhakta should understand it to be the fault of his own jeev, not the fault of his mind alone.
6.7 "If a person offers bhakti to Bhagvan with this understanding, the evil influence of some vimukh or his own mind will not be able to affect him even slightly. Then, he will be able to worship Bhagvan without any obstacles."

Gadhada III – 7
Bhagvan Is Sakar
7.1 In the Samvat year 1883, on Bhadarva vad 6 [22nd September 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow at His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. He was wearing garlands of mogra flowers around His neck, and tassels of mogra flowers also decorated His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
7.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said to all the bhaktas, "I shall now tell you my deepest principle. For a person who desires his own kalyan, nothing in this world is more blissful than Bhagvan and His sant. Therefore, just as a person is deeply attached to his own body, he should be similarly attached to Bhagvan and His sant. A person should also remain absolutely loyal to the bhaktas of Bhagvan. Even if while keeping that loyalty his reputation increases or decreases, or he is honoured or insulted, or he lives or dies, in no way should he abandon his loyalty to Bhagvan and His bhaktas. In addition, he should not allow hatred to develop towards them. Furthermore, he should not have as much love towards his body or bodily relations as he has towards the bhaktas of Bhagvan. For a bhakta who behaves in this way, even extremely powerful enemies, such as kam and krodh, are unable to defeat him."
7.3 Continuing, Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Bhagvan, who possesses a definite murti, is always present in His dham, Akshardham. Bhaktas of Bhagvan, who also possess a svarup, remain in His service in that dham. Therefore, a person who has taken firm refuge in the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan should not have the following fear in his mind: 'What if I become a ghost or an evil spirit, or attain the lok of Indra or the lok of Brahma after I die?' He should not have such doubts in his mind. After all, a bhakta of Bhagvan who possesses the understanding mentioned earlier definitely attains the dham of Bhagvan; Bhagvan does not leave him astray anywhere in between.
7.4 "Moreover, the bhakta should firmly keep his mind at the holy feet of Bhagvan. Just as an iron nail that is firmly affixed to an iron surface can never be separated, similarly, a person's mind should be fixed firmly at the holy feet of Bhagvan. When the bhakta has kept his mind at the holy feet of Bhagvan in this way, he does not have to die to attain the dham of Bhagvan – he attains it while still alive."
7.5 Having delivered this talk, Shreeji Maharaj bid "Jay Sachidanand" to everyone and then instructed the sabha to disperse.

Gadhada III – 8
Do Not Keep The Company Of A Vimukh
8.1 In the Samvat year 1883, on Bhadarva vad 9 [25th September 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Garlands of mogra flowers were hanging around His neck, and tassels of mogra flowers decorated His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
8.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked the munis, "How can a bhakta of Bhagvan remain eternally happy?" The senior sadhus replied according to their understanding, but then Shreeji Maharaj Himself said, "The answer is that a bhakta of Bhagvan who has firm vairagya and has extremely firm svadharma; who has gained control over all of his indriyas by these two means; who has intense love for the Bhagvan and His bhaktas; who has a close friendship with Bhagvan and His bhaktas; who never becomes indifferent towards Bhagvan and His bhaktas; and who is pleased only by the company of Bhagvan and His bhaktas, but does not like the company of a vimukh – remains eternally happy in this lok and beyond.
8.3 "A person, who has not controlled his indriyas by vairagya and svadharma remains miserable, despite staying in the company of Bhagvan and His bhakta. This is because a person who has not gained control over his indriyas does not experience happiness anywhere. Even while engaged in bhakti towards Bhagvan, when the indriyas are drawn towards the vishays, that bhakta experiences extreme misery in his heart. Therefore, only a person who gains control over his indriyas remains eternally happy. Furthermore, only a person who has gained control over his indriyas should be known to have vairagya and dharma. A person who has not controlled his indriyas should not be known to possess vairagya and dharma. Therefore, since a person who has vairagya and dharma has restraint over all of his indriyas, he is eternally happy."
8.4 Then, Muktanand Swami said, "Maharaj, for a bhakta of Bhagvan, what is the one greatest obstacle in his bhakti towards Bhagvan?"
8.5 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "For a bhakta of Bhagvan, the greatest obstacles are that he does not realise his own faults, his mind becomes distant from Bhagvan and His bhaktas, and he develops a lack of concern towards the bhakta of Bhagvan. These are the greatest obstacles for a bhakta."

Gadhada III – 9
Awareness
9.1 In the Samvat year 1883, on aso sud 11 [11th October 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes, and was wearing garlands around His neck, and gajara of flowers were tied around His arms. Also, tassels of flowers were hanging from His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
9.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said to all the bhaktas, "I shall now describe to all of you male and female bhaktas the sthiti and understanding of my senior paramhans as it truly is. After listening to this talk, I request all of you to narrate how you behave and to reveal your sthiti."
9.3 Saying this, Shreeji Maharaj began, "The senior sadhus in my muni-mandal behave in such a way that the awareness within their hearts is the gateway to the dham of Bhagvan. It is at this gateway where all the sadhus remain standing. Consider the following analogy: A king's guards, while standing at the entrance of the king's palace, do not allow any thieves or robbers to come near the king. They courageously believe, 'If anyone comes near the king to cause problems, we will cut them to pieces, but in no way will we let them reach the king'. With such courage, they wait, armed with shields and swords. Similarly, all these sadhus are standing at the gateway of the dham of Bhagvan in the form of awareness.
9.4 "Inside that gateway of awareness ( Akshardham) dwells Bhagvan, of whom they do darshan. They do not allow wealth, women, or any other worldly objects to enter that murti of Bhagvan in their heart. If any worldly object does forcefully attempt to enter the heart, they destroy that object, but in no way do they allow it to enter the location in their heart where they have secured Bhagvan. In this way, they constantly remain alert like a brave warrior. However, they do not move from their position, regardless of whether they encounter progress or regress, happiness or misery, praises or insults, or countless other types of difficulties.
9.5 "However, someone may doubt, 'If they do not move from their position, then how do they perform their bodily activities, such as eating and drinking?' I shall explain this using the following example: Consider a woman who goes to a well to draw water. She places her feet on the edge of the well. On the one hand, she remains cautious of this, for fear that she will fall into the well. However, her vrutti is also fixed upon drawing water from the well. In another example, a man who has mounted a horse is aware of his feet in the horse's stirrups and is also aware of the reins in his hands. While riding, he is also aware of the trees, ditches, and stones that come along the path. In the same way, all these sadhus, while keeping antar-drashti, remain in the seva of Bhagvan and also perform their bodily activities; but they are not deflected from their sthiti."
9.6 Shreeji Maharaj therefore revealed the sthiti of the senior sadhus and then said, "All of you should keep antar-drashti and constantly remain in the seva of Bhagvan. Moreover, you should not allow objects other than Bhagvan to become dearer to you than Him. All should be extremely cautious of this.
9.7 "After all, if a king's guard is careless while guarding the king, thieves and robbers would reach the king, and the guard's service would be rendered meaningless. Similarly, if a bhakta develops love for the objects other than Bhagvan, then money, women, and other objects also enter his heart, in which lies the awareness of Bhagvan. Due to this, his bhakti is rendered meaningless.
9.8 "Therefore, a person who wishes to keep his bhakti free from obstacles and to attain the holy feet of Bhagvan, should remain constantly vigilant at the gateway of the dham of Bhagvan in the form of awareness, and should not allow any objects except Bhagvan to enter his heart."
9.9 In this way, Shreeji Maharaj spoke words of wisdom for all of His bhaktas.

Gadhada III – 10
Vrundavan And Kashi
10.1 In the Samvat year 1883, on aso vad 12 [28th October 1826], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sadhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
10.2 In the sabha, an educated brahman of the Madhvi Sampraday came to Shreeji Maharaj. Shreeji Maharaj asked him, "In the shastras of your sampraday, Vrundavan is called the dham of Bhagvan. It is also said, 'Even at the time of final destruction, Vrundavan is not destroyed'. The followers of Shiv also claim, 'At the time of final destruction, Kashi is not destroyed'. But, I do not understand these statements. This is because during final destruction, pruthvi, jal, tej, vayu, and akash are completely destroyed, so how can Vrundavan and Kashi possibly remain? If they do remain, how are they supported? Such serious doubts arise."
10.3 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj asked for the Shreemad Bhagvat shastras to be brought, and the narration of the four types of destruction ( nitya- pralay, nimit- pralay, prakrut- pralay, and atyantik- pralay) from the eleventh and twelfth skandhs.
10.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Looking from the viewpoint of the Shreemad Bhagvat and the Geeta, during final destruction, nothing remains of anything that has evolved from Prakruti and Purush. So, if in final destruction Vrundavan does remain intact, then please quote a verse from the shastras of Vyasji or a verse from the Veds to prove it. There is no greater acharya than Vyasji. Others, who have become acharyas and have established their sampradays, have accepted the shastras of Vyasji as respected. Therefore, the words of Vyasji, the greatest acharya, are more respected than the words of all the other acharyas. So, using the words of Vyasji and the verse of the Veds, verify the statement, 'Vrundavan is not destroyed in the final destruction'. Only then will my doubt be cleared.
10.5 "Moreover, whoever has become an acharya has established his beliefs based on reference from the words of the Padma Puran. Mostly, they have established these beliefs by inserting fictional verses into the Padma Puran. As a result, no one besides their own followers believes them. Therefore, I will be convinced if you quote the words of the popular Shreemad Bhagvat Puran. This is because Vyasji had composed the Shreemad Bhagvat after taking the essence of all the Veds, Purans, and the historical shastras. Therefore, there is no Puran as perfectly respected as the Shreemad Bhagvat. Also, the whole of the Mahabharat is not as respected as the Bhagvad Geeta. Therefore, quote the words of such powerful shastras to convince me."
10.6 After hearing these words of Shreeji Maharaj, the brahman said, "Maharaj, the question you have raised is logical. There is no one on this earth capable of answering your question. In my mind, I have formed a firm belief, 'You are the acharya of all acharyas, and the ishvar of all ishvars'. Therefore, please have compassion on me and explain to me your principle."
10.7 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "From the Veds, the Purans, the historical shastras, and the Smrutis, I have formed the belief that jeev, maya, ishvar, Brahm, and Parbrahm are all eternal. Consider it as follows: Maya represents the soil, the jeevs represent the seeds in the soil, and ishvar, represents the rain. By the will of Bhagvan, an ishvar – in the form of Purush – unites with Maya. As a result, just as the seeds in the soil sprout by the association of rainwater, similarly, the jeevs, which are eternal, arise from within Maya; but new jeevs are not created. Therefore, just as ishvar is eternal, Maya is eternal. The jeevs residing within Maya are also eternal, and they are not components of Bhagvan; they are always jeevs.
10.8 "When a jeev seeks the refuge of Bhagvan, it overcomes Bhagvan's Maya, becomes brahm-rup like Narad and the Sanakadik, attains the dham of Bhagvan, and becomes His parshad. This is my principle."
10.9 Hearing these words of Shreeji Maharaj, the brahman abandoned his Vaishnav beliefs, accepted Shreeji Maharaj's refuge, and was initiated into the Uddhav Sampraday.

Gadhada III – 11
Understanding Like That Of Sitaji
11.1 In the Samvat year 1883, on Ashadh sud 3 [27th June 1827], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
11.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I wish to ask the following question: Is there one method to overcome both the indriyas and the mind? Or is the method to overcome the indriyas different from the means to overcome the mind? That is the question."
11.3 The senior paramhans replied according to their understanding, but they were unable to give a precise answer.
11.4 So, Shreeji Maharaj said Himself, "The answer is that the indriyas are overcome by vairagya, svadharma, tap, and niyams; and the mind is overcome by the nine types of bhakti coupled with the knowledge of Bhagvan's greatness."
11.5 Muktanand Swami then asked, "How can the type of bliss that a bhakta of Bhagvan enjoys in nirvikalp samadhi be enjoyed even without samadhi?"
11.6 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If the bhakta has profound attachment and deep love for Bhagvan and His bhaktas, just like the attachment and love that he has for his own body, then the type of bliss that prevails in nirvikalp samadhi will continue to remain forever, even without that samadhi. That is the only answer."
11.7 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked paramhans, "What type of understanding must a bhakta have, where he will in no way recede from the path of kalyan regardless of the unpleasant circumstances he may encounter, and where he develops such firmness that he will not be affected by any obstacles whatsoever?"
11.8 The senior sadhus attempted to answer according to their understanding, but Shreeji Maharaj's question was not completely answered.
11.9 So, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The answer to this is as follows: If a person is profoundly attached to Bhagvan and His bhaktas, just as he is attached to his body, then he will not be affected by any obstacles. In fact, regardless of the extent of unpleasant circumstances he may encounter, he will not turn away from Bhagvan and His bhaktas."
11.10 Then, Shreeji Maharaj addressed the paramhans again. He said, "When Sitaji was exiled to the forest by Ramchandraji, she felt great sorrow. Lakshmanji was also very unhappy. But then Sitaji explained to Lakshmanji, 'I am not crying because of my own grief; I am crying for the grief of Ramchandraji. He is extremely compassionate, and since he has exiled me to the forest out of fear of public accusation, he must be thinking, "I have sent Sita to the forest without any fault of her own." Knowing this and being compassionate, he must be experiencing severe grief in his mind. So, please tell Ramchandraji, "Sita is not distressed; she will go to Valmiki Rushi's ashram and happily engage in your worship there. So, do not feel any sorrow on account of Sita's distress." Please pass this message to Ramchandraji. Sitaji sent this message with Lakshmanji, but in no way did she perceive faults in Ramchandraji.
11.11 "Now, one bhakta is such that he does not perceive faults in Bhagvan and His bhaktas, but his vairagya and dharma are moderate. On the other hand, another bhakta has intense vairagya and dharma, but does not have an understanding like that of Sita. Of these two types of bhaktas, which type should a person lovingly keep the company of?"
11.12 Chaitanyanand Swami replied, "A person should only keep the company – with intense love – of someone who has an understanding like Sitaji, even though that person's dharma and vairagya may be moderate. He should not keep the company of someone, who perceives faults in Bhagvan and His bhaktas, even though that person may have intense vairagya and dharma."
11.13 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The answer is correct."

Perceiving Avgun In Bhagvan And His Sant
12.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Ashadh vad 8 [16th July 1827], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in the balcony of the medi of His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
12.2 Then, for the benefit of His bhaktas, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A person who desires his own kalyan should not have any form of pride, such as, 'I have been born in an upper-class family', or 'I am wealthy', or 'I am handsome', or 'I am a scholar'. He should not keep any of these beliefs. In fact, even with a humble satsangi, he should behave as a das of a das.
12.3 "Furthermore, even though he may be called a satsangi, a person who has perceived avgun in Bhagvan or His bhaktas should be known to be like a rabid dog. Just as a person who is touched by the saliva of a rabid dog also become rabid, similarly, if a person listens to the talks of or keeps affection for someone who has perceived avgun in Bhagvan or His bhaktas, then both the person who keeps the affection and the listener become like a vimukh. Then, just as tuberculosis is never cured by any medicine, similarly, the demonic attitude of a person who has perceived avgun in Bhagvan or His bhaktas is never eradicated from his heart. On the other hand, a person who may have killed countless brahmans; or may have killed countless children; or may have killed countless women; or may have killed countless cows; or may have even associated many times with the wife of his guru, can be freed from these sins at some time or other. In fact, the shastras even describe the methods to do so. However, no shastra describes methods to be released from the sin of perceiving avgun in Bhagvan or His bhaktas. If a person consumes poison, or falls into the ocean, or falls from a mountain, or is eaten by a demon, then he has to die only once. However, a person who insults Bhagvan or His bhaktas has to continuously die and be reborn for countless millions of years.
12.4 "At most, a disease leads to the death of the body; or an enemy destroys the body; but, the jeev is not destroyed. However, by insulting Bhagvan or His bhaktas, the jeev is also destroyed. Someone may ask, 'How can the jeev be destroyed?' Well, for example, a hermaphrodite cannot be called a man or a woman, he can only be called impotent. Similarly, the jeev of a person who insults Bhagvan or His bhaktas also becomes impotent; the jeev is never able to make an effort for his own kalyan. Therefore, his jeev should be known as having been destroyed. Knowing this, a person should never insult Bhagvan or His bhaktas.
12.5 "In addition, a person should not have deep affection for his bodily relations, even if they happen to be satsangis. For example, if a snake's venom falls into some sweetened milk, then whoever drinks it will die. In the same way, even if a person's bodily relations are bhaktas of Bhagvan, they are still mixed with venom (relationships). Therefore, a person who has affection for them will definitely sacrifice his kalyan. Knowing this, a person who wishes for his own kalyan should not maintain affection for his bodily relations. In this way, after becoming detached from worldly life and having love for the holy feet of Bhagvan, a person should continue to engage in the worship of Bhagvan.
12.6 "A person who retains the talk that I have just delivered within his heart, will never encounter obstacles on the path of kalyan. In fact, this talk is like a miraculous technique."
12.7 Shreeji Maharaj concluded the talk with these words.

The Wish Of Bhagvan Is Our Prarabdha
13.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Ashadh vad 9 [17th July 1827], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Garlands of mogra flowers were hanging around His neck, and tassels decorated His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the munis were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of a dukad and saroda.
13.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please stop singing the kirtans, and let us talk about Bhagvan." Shreeji Maharaj asked a question to the muni-mandal: "A jeev's body is dependent upon the karmas performed in past lives. That is why it is not always so stable. For example, sometimes a person remains healthy, and sometimes he becomes ill; sometimes he functions independently, and sometimes he becomes dependent, where he may or may not be able to stay where he chooses; and sometimes he may be able to stay in the company of bhaktas, but sometimes he may even be separated from them and be forced to live alone. All of this is due to the influence of karma or kal. In such circumstance, a person's determination in observing niyams becomes unsteady.
13.3 "Further, if a ruler like the British detains a person; or if a person's mind and indriyas – which are also like the British rulers – keep him under their control, then it is uncertain whether he will stay in the company of sadhus or follow the niyams of satsang. Having said this, the shastras have specifically stated: 'If a person perfectly possesses all four of the qualities of dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti, then he can be called an ekantik bhakta, and such a person attains ultimate kalyan'. Also, it seems unlikely that the physical conditions will remain stable under the influence of Kal and karma. Therefore, how can a bhakta of Bhagvan maintain his ekantik state? That is the question."
13.4 Then, Gopalanand Swami, Chaitanyanand Swami, Nityanand Swami, Muktanand Swami, Brahmanand Swami, Shuk Muni, and other senior sadhus answered according to whatever they felt was correct but were unable to answer the question satisfactorily.
13.5 Shreeji Maharaj then said in reply, "Please listen as I reveal to you the way in which my belief of Bhagvan remains firms." He then began, "Regardless of how much pain or pleasure comes my way, and regardless of whether wealth or poverty comes my way, in those circumstances, first I realise the immense greatness of Bhagvan. On seeing the riches and royal wealth of the great kings of this world, it is this understanding that allows me to not associate even the slightest amount of significance to them in my heart. I believe that for me, there is nothing greater than Bhagvan; and so my mind is firmly attached to His holy feet. In fact, my love for Bhagvan is so firm that even Kal, karma, and Maya are incapable of destroying that love. Even if my own mind attempts to destroy that love for Bhagvan, it cannot be destroyed. In fact, my love is such that regardless of the extent of happiness or misery that may happen to come my way, the love is not destroyed.
13.6 "Also, the natural inclination of my mind is such that I do not at all prefer to live in cities, in mansions or in royal palaces. On the contrary, I very much prefer to stay where there are forests, mountains, rivers, trees, or in some secluded place. I feel that it would be nice to sit alone in some secluded place and perform dhyan upon Bhagvan. That is what I prefer at all times. In fact, before I had the darshan of Ramanand Swami, I had already decided with Muktanand Swami, 'After you arrange for me to have the darshan of Ramanand Swami, the two of us will retire to the forest and constantly engage ourselves in the dhyan of Bhagvan, and never shall we return to stay amongst people'. Such was the determination in my mind then; even now, I feel exactly the same.
13.7 "In addition, the profound love that I have for Bhagvan and His bhaktas is so strong that even Kal, karma, and Maya are incapable of eradicating that love. In fact, even if my own mind attempted to eradicate it, it would definitely not be eradicated from my heart. Such is the intense love I have for Bhagvan and His bhaktas.
13.8 "Many times I have become disheartened and felt like leaving this satsang, but I have remained here on seeing the bhaktas; I could in no way abandon them and leave. In fact, I would be unable to stay where I do not find such bhaktas of Bhagvan, even if someone were to try by a million methods to keep me there. Regardless of how well a person may serve me, I simply cannot get along with someone who is not a bhakta of Bhagvan. In this way, I have attached my mind with profound love to Bhagvan and His bhaktas; and other than that Bhagvan, I have no liking for anything else. If that is so, why should love for Bhagvan not remain? When I am engaged in kathas or kirtans related to Bhagvan, I experience such happiness that I feel as if I shall become mad due to it. In fact, whatever calmness remains is solely for the benefit of the bhaktas; but in the mind, the very same happiness always remains; although outwardly, I behave in accordance with the customs of society.
13.9 "It is that very Bhagvan who is the sole controller of this body. If He wishes, He may seat him on an elephant; or if He wishes, He may have it thrown in prison; or if He so wishes, He may even place some serious illness in the body. Despite this, a person should never pray before Bhagvan in the following way: 'Maharaj! Please relieve me of my misery'. This is because we want this body to behave in accordance with the wishes of Bhagvan; after all, Bhagvan's wish is our wish. We do not want our preferences to differ from the preferences of Bhagvan even in the slightest way. Moreover, since we have offered our body, mind, and wealth to Bhagvan, then only the wish of Bhagvan is our prarabdha; besides that, there is no other prarabdha for us. Therefore, regardless of whatever pain or pleasure we may encounter by the wish of Bhagvan, we should not become disturbed in any way; we should be pleased with whatever pleases Bhagvan.
13.10 "Therefore, Bhagvan Himself protects the dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti of a bhakta who has such intense love for Bhagvan. Occasionally, due to the prevalence of unpleasant circumstances, it may outwardly appear that such a bhakta is disobeying dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti, but inwardly, there is no disobedience at all."
13.11 In this way, by quoting His own example, Shreeji Maharaj described the understanding of an extremely firm bhakta of Bhagvan, and how he should develop firm love for Bhagvan.

Gadhada III – 14
Love And Faith - The Kayasth's Unworthy Desire
14.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Ashadh vad 11 [19th July 1827], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Tassels of flowers were hanging from the pagh upon His head, and garlands of flowers were hanging around His neck. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some munis were singing kirtans.
14.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please stop the singing and begin a question-answer discussion."
14.3 Then, Muktanand Swami asked with folded hands "Maharaj, there is nothing more essential than Bhagvan; yet why does an individual not develop deep love for Him? That is the question."
14.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "He has no wisdom. If he did have wisdom, he would think, 'I have accepted the vow of brahm-charya, yet the desire to enjoy the pleasures of women still has not disappeared from my heart. That is very improper as I have invariably enjoyed the pleasures of women when I have taken birth in the 8.4 million life forms – and those pleasures have always been much greater than those experienced in a human birth'. When this jeev was born as a goat, it must have single-handedly indulged in the pleasures of a thousand female goats. When it took birth as a horse, or a bull, or a buffalo, or a king monkey, or indeed any other animal, it must have encountered countless young, beautiful females of its own species. This was not due to prarabdha, nor was it due to Bhagvan's grace – it was only natural. Moreover, if a person does not worship Bhagvan, he will obtain countless females in whichever life-form he is born in. This would not be due to the seva or puja of some dev, or to the chanting of some mantra; as the opportunity of enjoying women and other pleasures is natural.
14.5 This jeev has become a dev several times, where it has enjoyed the pleasures of Dev-Lok; many times it has become an emperor of the world and enjoyed countless pleasures on this earth. Despites this, the jeev's craving to enjoy women and other objects has still not diminished. Instead, a person feels that the pleasures of women and other objects are extremely rare and, realising their immense pleasure, develops affection for them. That affection is such that it can in no way be eradicated, however much a person tries. It is because of this sin that the jeev is unable to develop deep love for Bhagvan.
14.5 "I have personally seen with my own eyes how the jeev has such impure, worldly desires. When I was young, I used to go to a mandir of Shiv in Ayodhya and sleep there. One day, a Kayasth came to offer puja to Shiv and ask for the following vardan: 'O Maharaj! O Shivji! Never grant me a human birth again. In this human birth, I have taken so many aphrodisiacs, yet I have been unable to fully enjoy the pleasures of women to my satisfaction. Therefore, O Shivji! Please grant me the body of a donkey for many lives to come so that I can fully enjoy the pleasures of females without shame or restrictions'. He asked for this vardan from Shivji daily. So, because of this sin of harbouring worldly desires, the jeev does not develop love for Bhagvan in any way."
14.6 Muktanand Swami then asked further, "Maharaj, a person who does not have wisdom does not develop love for Bhagvan. But, what about someone who believes that Bhagvan is the ocean of all bliss, and that all objects other than Bhagvan are certainly full of only misery? Despite knowing this, why does he not develop love for Bhagvan?"
14.7 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "In either a past life or in this present life, that person has been influenced by extremely unpleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang. Due to this, he has performed very intense, sinful karmas that have left impressions on his mind. Therefore, despite being able to discriminate between good and bad, he is unable to avoid the bad and develop deep love for Bhagvan. Moreover, just as the influence of unpleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang causes the impressions of sinful karmas to influence the mind, similarly, the influence of extremely pleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang causes a person to perform very intense, pure karmas. The influence of these pure karmas will destroy the very intense, sinful karmas. Only then does a person develop deep love for Bhagvan. That is the answer to the question."
14.8 Then, Ayodhyaprasadji asked, "Suppose there is a person who is very intelligent, and whose knowledge of the shastras is also exceptional. On the other hand, there is a person who is not so intelligent and who has a limited understanding of the shastras. Nevertheless, the person who is very intelligent falls from satsang, whereas a person who is not intelligent remains firm in satsang. What is the reason for this?"
14.9 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "There are two types of people in this world: religious and demonic. Of these, those who are demonic will fall from satsang, despite being exceptionally intelligent; whereas those who are religious will never fall from satsang, even though they may not be intelligent. For example, if a person sows a seed of chilli or the seed of a neem tree or the seed of a shingadiyo vachhnag plant and he waters them daily with sweet water, the chillies will still turn out to be spicy; the neem tree will still be bitter; and the shingadiyo vachhnag plant will still be poisonous. This is because that is the nature of the seeds themselves. On the other hand, if a person sows sugarcane, the juice of the sugarcane will still be sweet despite treating it with compost from leaves of a neem tree and watering it with bitter water. In the same way, religious people will always stay on the path of Bhagvan, and demonic people will always turn away from the path of Bhagvan."
14.10 Then, Shuk Muni asked, "How can a person distinguish between a religious person and a demonic person?"
14.11 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "In a religious person, vicious natures such as kam, krodh, and lobh, are due to the influence of unpleasant circumstances. However, they are destroyed within a short time under the influence of pleasant circumstances. On the other hand, in a demonic person, vicious natures such as kam, krodh, and lobh, are never destroyed. If someone were to speak some harsh words to a demonic person even once, he would not forget them for as long as he lives. Then, if that demonic person were to become a satsangi, he would initially appear to be better than all the other bhaktas. But, he would be like silt that has gathered in the region of Bhal – where there was previously sea – has made the soil fertile. As long as the silt remains, sweet water can be obtained by digging below; but, if a person were to dig much deeper, then extremely saline water would emerge. In the same way, even if a demonic person has become a bhakta of Bhagvan, the moment his wishes are not fulfilled and he is even slightly disturbed, then compared to the seva of the sadhus he had previously performed, he would insult them thousands of times more. Even then, his mind would not be happy."
14.12 Muktanand Swami then asked, "Maharaj, you said that a demonic person who becomes a bhakta will remain in satsang as long as his wishes are fulfilled; and if they are not fulfilled, he falls from satsang. But, what if he happens to die before falling from satsang? Will he remain demonic, or will he become religious?"
14.13 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "As long as the demonic person is good when he encounters death, and he offers bhakti to Bhagvan, he will become religious and will attain Akshardham."
14.14 Then, Nrusinhanand Swami asked, "Of the nine types of bhakti, which is the best?"
14.15 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Of the nine types of bhakti, whichever type helps a person in developing firm attachment to Bhagvan is the best type of bhakti for that particular person."
14.16 Then, Gopalanand Swami asked, "During childhood or during youth, what type of company should a person seek?"
14.17 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "Both should lovingly keep the company of a person who is senior in age, is firm in dharma, gnan, and vairagya; and has deep love for Bhagvan."
14.18 Then Naja Jogiya asked, "Which is the best of the three: a person whose mind is attached to Bhagvan out of anger, a person whose mind is attached to Bhagvan out of fear, or a person whose mind is attached to Bhagvan out of love?"
14.19 Shreeji Maharaj said, "A person whose mind is attached to Bhagvan out of love is the best."
14.20 Then, Shivanand Swami asked, "How can a bhakta of Bhagvan who does not possess wisdom of what is good and bad as described by Shreeji Maharaj, and who also lacks vairagya, develop such wisdom, and also develop vairagya towards all objects other than Bhagvan?"
14.21 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If a person develops firm love for Bhagvan from the initial stages, then due to that love, wisdom and vairagya will automatically develop. Now, consider the following: When a person is attached to an object, it is called affection or desire. Then, if someone were to obstruct the gaining of any object for which he has affection, he would become angry on that person. This applies not only to humans; even animals express such anger. For example, due to lust, a buffalo that is attached to a female buffalo will kill another buffalo that approaches the female; this behaviour is widely observed in all types of animals. In the same way, a person with deep love for Bhagvan immediately becomes angry on any object that acts as an obstruction in that love and he immediately abandons that object. Therefore, a person who has deep love for Bhagvan automatically develops vairagya as well as wisdom."
14.22 Again, Shivanand Swami asked, "Suppose there are two types of people, both of whom are intelligent. Of these, one possesses faith and accepts whatever Bhagvan says; whereas the other accepts only those words of Bhagvan that he feels are appropriate. Of the two, who is better?"
14.23 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "Only the person who possesses faith is better. Ramchandraji has said in the Ramayan, 'I protect a person who has firm faith in me – just as a mother protects her child'. Therefore, only the person with faith is better."
14.24 Then, atmanand Swami asked, "In a person's mind, he is determined to behave according to the wishes of Bhagvan for the rest of his life. However, he still feels, 'What can a person do for Bhagvan and His sant to earn their trust?'"
14.25 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "Firstly, a person earns the trust of Bhagvan and His sant when he does not have hatred towards anyone and does not feel disheartened, even if he falls severely ill and is not cared for very well during that illness. Secondly, even if he is harshly insulted by Bhagvan and His sant without any fault of his own, he still does not have hatred towards anyone. Thirdly, if he were to even slightly disobey his observance of the niyams of this satsang, he would feel extremely apologetic and would immediately perform prayshchit. Also, even if he were to entertain an evil thought in his mind, he would feel just as apologetic and distressed as someone who had happened to physically disobey the observance of the niyams. A person with these characteristics earns the complete trust of Bhagvan and His sant, and they feel, 'This person will never fall back from satsang'. "
14.26 Then, Bhagvadanand Swami asked, "How can others recognise a bhakta who continuously understands the greatness of Bhagvan and His bhaktas in his mind?"
14.27 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "A person who continuously understands the greatness of Bhagvan and His bhaktas in his mind serves them sincerely and lovingly. He physically bows and touches the feet of all the sadhus. If a sadhu were to fall ill, he would massage his head and feet and also take care of his dietary needs. If he were to receive some object that he liked, he would first offer it to the sadhus before using it for himself. A person, who behaves in this way by thought, word, and deed, should be known to have fully understood the greatness of Bhagvan and His sant within his heart."
14.28 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked the sadhus a question: "A person may possess intense dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti. However sometimes, there may be some relaxation in his observance of dharma; there may be some attachment despite having vairagya; there may be some reduction in his bhakti; and attachment to his body may still remain despite having gnan. What can be the reason for this?"
14.29 Gopalanand Swami and Brahmanand Swami replied, "If there appears to be a flaw in a person who possesses intense dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti – a person who can be thought of as being as powerful as Bhagvan Himself – it remains purely out of compassion; it is not a flaw. In fact, when such a great person behaves with bahya-drashti, he transforms many jeevs to the ranks of Jadbharat and Shukji. Therefore, such an extremely great person behaves in a worldly way purely out of compassion for the jeevs."
14.30 Hearing their reply, Shreeji Maharaj said, "That is precisely the correct answer to the question."

Gadhada III – 15
Applying Bandages To Wounds
15.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Ashadh vad 13 [21st July 1827], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in the balcony of the medi of His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes and was also wearing garlands of mogra flowers around His neck. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
15.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said to Muktanand Swami, "Today, I had a long talk with the bhaktas (Jeevu-Ba and Ladu-Ba) who cook for me."
15.3 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, what did you talk about?"
15.4 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "The talk was that when a bhakta of Bhagvan sits to perform the mansi puja of Bhagvan or sits to perform dhyan upon Bhagvan, he remembers the times in the past when his jeev has surrendered to the panch-vishays due to the influence of unpleasant circumstances or the influence of vicious natures. For example, a warrior who returns injured from the battlefield rests on a bedstead due to his wound. However, until his wounds are not dressed with bandages, the pain of the wounds does not decrease and he is not able to sleep. Only when bandages are applied to his wounds is he relieved of his pain and only then is he able to sleep. In the same way, the jeev has been 'wounded' by the panch-vishays due to the influence of unpleasant desh, kal, kriya, and sang. Whichever of the nine types of bhakti relieves the pain of these 'wounds' caused by the vishays and makes a person unaware of the vishays themselves, should be thought of as the application of a bandage to the 'wounds'. Also, that particular type of bhakti should be known to be his strength in worshipping Bhagvan.
15.5 "Then, abiding by that particular strength, a person should engage in mansi puja or the mental chanting of Bhagvan's name. In fact, whatever he may do, he should do so within his own particular strength. He will benefit tremendously as a result of this.
15.6 "However, just as a wounded warrior experiences no peace until his wounds are bandaged, similarly, if a person fails to recognise his own particular strength, he will not experience any happiness at all during bhajan and smaran, and the pain due to the 'wounds' caused by the vishays will not be relieved. Therefore, after recognising which of the nine types of bhakti cause his mind to be fixed on Bhagvan and prevents him from indulging in any thoughts other than those of Bhagvan, that bhakta should realise, 'This is my particular strength'. Then, he should keep that type of bhakti predominant. This method is a universal principle."

Gadhada III – 16
Bhakti Like A Pati Vrata
16.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Ashadh vad Amas [23rd July 1827], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. He was wearing garlands of mogra flowers around His neck, and extremely beautiful tassels were hanging from His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
16.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "I ask a question to the entire muni-mandal and to all the grahastha bhaktas; whoever can reply may do so. The question is as follows: It does not take very long for a bhakta of Bhagvan to avoid the company of a person who is full of avgun. But, how is it possible to avoid the company of a person with extremely noble gun? After all, a person naturally develops affection for a person with gun, regardless of whether he is a relative or not. Moreover, affection that is formed, due to the influence of those gun, cannot be eradicated, however much a person tries. Therefore, how does a bhakta of Bhagvan prevent the development of affection for anyone other than Bhagvan, regardless of the gun of that person? That is the question."
16.3 The senior sadhus replied according to their understanding, but were unable to answer Shreeji Maharaj's question.
16.4 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Allow me to answer. The answer is as follows: A pati vrata is not even slightly impressed in her mind on seeing other rich, handsome, or young men, even if her husband is poor, ugly, ill, or old. If she does happen to affectionately look at or laugh with other men, then she breaks her pati vrata vow. If some guests were to come to the house of that pati vrata, she would offer them food and water. If she offers food and water to some male relative of her husband, she does so knowing him to be related to her husband, but the affection she has for all other men does not even come close to the love she has for her husband; nor does she see gun in other men as she sees in her own husband. Moreover, she acts according to the wishes of her own husband. Such is the firm fidelity that a pati vrata wife has towards her husband.
16.5 "In the same way, a bhakta should have firm loyalty to Bhagvan. Specifically, like a woman who is a pati vrata, he would never develop the same love towards even other mukta sadhus – however great they may be – as he has developed towards whichever murti of Bhagvan he has had the darshan of. He does not develop love for other avatars of his ishta-dev. He keeps love only for the murti that he has attained, and he acts according to His wishes only. If he does happen to respect others, it is only because of their association with his Bhagvan. A person who has such faithful bhakti towards his own ishta-dev, never develops affection on seeing others, even though he may have many gun.
16.6 "For example, Hanumanji is a bhakta of Shree Ramchandraji. Following the avatar of Ram, there have been many other avatars of Bhagvan, but Hanumanji's bhakti has been like that of a woman who observes the vow of fidelity, as he has remained faithful to only Ramchandraji. This is why Hanumanji's bhakti is considered to be like that of a pati vrata. The bhakti of a bhakta of Bhagvan who has such fidelity can be said to be like that of a pati vrata. Conversely, if a person does not have fidelity, his bhakti can be said to be like that of a prostitute. Therefore, a person should not knowingly engage in bhakti that would cause him to be disgraced. Instead, a bhakta of Bhagvan should thoughtfully engage in faithful bhakti – like that of a pati vrata."

Gadhada III – 17
The Story Of Bharatji
17.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Shravan sud 6 [30th July 1827], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes and was wearing garlands of flowers around His neck. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
17.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "There is no story in the Shreemad Bhagvat as incredible as the story of Bharatji. This is because Bharatji was the son of Rushabh-Dev Bhagvan, and for the specific purpose of realising Bhagvan, he gave up his kingdom, which consisted of the whole world, and retired to the forest. Then, while engaged in the worship of Bhagvan, he developed affection for a young deer. As a result, his mind's vrutti took the form of that deer. As a result, despite his greatness, Bharatji was reborn as a deer due to the sin of that attachment.
17.3 "As a matter of fact, there are countless types of sins; but for a bhakta of Bhagvan, of all those sins, having affection for anything except Bhagvan is an extremely great sin. Therefore, if a wise person thinks over this story of Bharatji, he becomes extremely fearful in his heart with the thought, 'What if I develop affection for anything other than Bhagvan?' In this way, he becomes extremely afraid.
17.4 "Then, when Bharatji gave up the body of the deer, he was born in a brahman family. Then, out of fear of developing affection for anything other than Bhagvan, he paid no attention at all to worldly affairs and deliberately behaved as a madman. He lived in a way where he could maintain his vrutti constantly on Bhagvan."
17.5 After delivering this talk, Shreeji Maharaj left to attend the arti.

Worldly Desires Become Old
18.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Shravan vad 10 [17th August 1827], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Garlands of flowers were hanging around His neck, and tassels of flowers were hanging from His pagh. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
18.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj's nephew, Raghuvirji, asked a question: "Why does the jeev's condition during the svapna state not remain the same as it is during the jagrat state?"
18.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The jeev behaves in the svapna state exactly as it does in the jagrat state. After all, the same types of worldly desire, which appear while awake, spring forth in dreams as well."
18.4 Then, Nirlobhanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, many times, objects that have never been seen or heard in the jagrat state, spring forth in dreams. What may be the reason for this?"
18.5 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "If objects that have never been previously seen or heard appear in the svapna state, it is due to embedded desires created by karmas performed in past lives."
18.6 Then, Akhandanand Swami asked, "Maharaj, for a person who becomes a bhakta of Bhagvan, how long does the force of karmas performed in past lives remain?"
18.7 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "When that person comes into contact with a sat-purush, the embedded desires created by his past karmas gradually wear away as he consistently associates with him. Eventually, he reaches a stage where the desires that give rise to births and deaths no longer remain. For example, grains of rice that are three to four years old can be eaten; but if they are sown, they would not grow. In the same way, when the embedded desires generated by the previously performed karmas degenerate, they do not lead to further births and deaths.
18.8 "However, a person may ask, 'How does a person recognise whether those embedded desires have degenerated or not?' Well, consider the analogy of a contest between two men armed with shields and swords. As long as both can withstand each other, the strength of both appears to be equal. But, the moment a person draws back, he is said to have been defeated. Similarly, for a bhakta of Bhagvan, as long as thoughts related to Bhagvan and the thoughts related to the vishays appear to be equal, he should realise his worldly desires to be more powerful. However, when thoughts related to Bhagvan displace those related to the vishays, he should realise that his worldly desires have reduced."
18.9 Shreeji Maharaj then asked the paramhans a question: "How can a bhakta, who no longer identifies himself with the body and who has developed hatred for the panch-vishays, be recognised by other bhaktas?"
18.10 Muktanand Swami replied, "Maharaj, we are incapable of answering your question. Please be compassionate and answer it yourself."
18.11 So, Shreeji Maharaj then said, "Whether he is a grahastha or a tyagi, a bhakta of Bhagvan who no longer believes himself to be the body and whose attachment for the panch-vishays has been eradicated, may be required to behave as if he is the body depending on Bhagvan's instructions to him; he may also have to indulge in the panch-vishays if necessary. For example, a frail bull can be made to stand with the support of a stick and by people holding it by its horn and tail. But, it will remain standing only as long as someone holds it up; the moment it is released, it will fall to the ground. Similarly, a person who is free of worldly desires engages in activities only to the extent of the instructions given by Bhagvan.
18.12 In another example, take a person with a bow and arrow in hand. The bow bends as the person pulls back the string; when he releases the arrow, the bow becomes slack again. In the same way, a person free of worldly desires engages himself in activities only to the extent of Bhagvan's wish, but never does he do anything which disobeys that. On the other hand, when a person with worldly desires engages in activities, he is unable to detach himself from those activities of his own accord; he is unable to do so even when Bhagvan instructs him. These are the characteristics of a person free of worldly desires and a person with worldly desires."

Gadhada III – 19
Two Undesirable Traits Of A Tyagi
19.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Shravan vad 13 [20th August 1827], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Also, garlands of mogra and karnikar were hanging around His neck. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
19.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A bhakta who has abandoned worldly life may possess two negative traits which are not appropriate for him in this satsang; the first is lust and the second is affection for his relatives. In my eyes, a person who possesses these two negative traits is like an animal. Of these two, I have an extreme repulsion for a person who has excessive affection for his relatives.
19.3 "For this reason, a person who has abandoned worldly life should not keep even the slightest amount of affection for his relatives. This is because having affection for bodily relatives is a greater sin than the five great sins. Therefore, a tyagi bhakta of Bhagvan should realise his own chaitanya to be distinct from both the body and the relatives of the body. He should believe, 'I am the atma; I have no relations at all with anyone'. In fact, the relatives of this body should be considered together with the relatives of the 8.4 million types of previous life forms. If a person does try to understand the greatness of his relatives, knowing them to be satsangis, then since there is already some affection due to the fact that they are related, he develops more affection for them than he has for Bhagvan and the bhaktas of Bhagvan. Therefore, if a person does keep affection for his relatives knowing them to be bhaktas of Bhagvan, towards whom affection is natural, then his life becomes useless.
19.4 "Moreover, it is also natural for a person to develop affection for those who perform his seva, even though they may not be his relatives. So, a person who is wise should not keep affection towards a person who is serving him, even if that person happens to be a bhakta of Bhagvan. For example, if a snake has released venom into sweetened milk, the mixture also becomes poisonous. Similarly, out of self-interest, a person should not keep affection towards someone who performs his seva, even if the person serving happens to be a bhakta. This is because his jeev becomes attached due to that seva. Then, just as he thinks about Bhagvan, he also begins to think about the person who serves his needs. For that person, this in itself is an obstacle in his worship of Bhagvan – just as the young deer itself becomes avidya ( maya) for Bharatji. In this way, a bhakta of Bhagvan should totally avoid all those who obstruct his worship of Bhagvan, knowing them to be avidya."
19.5 Shreeji Maharaj then concluded by adding, "The paramhans and all the sankhya- yogi bhaktas should daily say and listen to this talk which I have just delivered. Specifically, the senior member of a mandal should daily narrate this talk, and others should listen. If the senior person fails to do so, he should do upvas on that day. Those who do not come to listen to that talk of Bhagvan with shraddha should also do upvas. Please remember these words firmly in your lives."

Svabhav And Vasna
20.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on the night of Shravan vad Amas [22nd August 1827], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sadhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
20.2 Then, Dina-Nath Bhatt asked a question: "Maharaj, Kal is the power of Bhagvan, and karma refers to the actions performed by the jeev. But, what exactly is svabhav?"
20.3 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The karmas that the jeev has performed during past lives have fully developed and have become absorbed within the jeev. Just as fire 'enters' iron, similarly, those karmas have developed and have become one with the jeev. It is those karmas that are known as svabhav, or vasna, or prakruti."
20.4 Muktanand Swami then asked, "Maharaj, the karmas which have become absorbed within the jeev, are called svabhav or vasna. But, how does a person eradicate vasna?"
20.5 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "It appears that the only means to do so is by performing the bhakti of Shree Krishna Bhagvan, coupled with the atma-nishtha. If a person offers bhakti to Shree Krishna Bhagvan without atma- nishtha, then just as he has love for Bhagvan, he will also develop love for other material objects. Therefore, bhakti accompanied by atma- nishtha is the only means to eradicate vasna. However, even a person who has atma- nishtha may be disturbed by unpleasant circumstances, just like an ignorant person. However, such disturbances do not last long."

Gadhada III – 21
Dharma And Ekantik Dharma
21.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Bhadarva sud 9 [31st August 1827], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a mattress with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a decorated bedstead outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes, and garlands of chameli flowers were hanging around His neck. A sabha of the entire muni-mandal, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
21.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj requested Gopalanand Swami and Shuk Muni to begin a question-answer discussion.
21.3 Then, Shuk Muni asked Gopalanand Swami, "It is through offering bhakti to Bhagvan that the jeev crosses Bhagvan's Maya and attains Akshardham. Through dharma, it attains Dev-Lok; but once the rewards it has accumulated are exhausted, the jeev falls from Dev-Lok. Now, whenever there is a decline in dharma, Bhagvan assumes an avatar for the purpose of restoring bhakti. However, it appears that whatever can be attained through bhakti cannot be attained through dharma. Therefore, how can the level of dharma be elevated to the status of bhakti? That is the question."
21.4 Gopalanand Swami began to answer that question. In whatever he said, dharma became a component of bhakti, but in no way could he elevate the level of dharma to the status of bhakti.
21.5 On hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj laughed a great deal, and commented, "To answer that question is difficult indeed. Therefore, allow me to answer it." He then explained, "Dharma is of two types: One is nivrutti dharma and the other is pravrutti dharma. In turn, these two types of dharma can either be related to Bhagvan or not to Bhagvan. Of these two, the type of dharma that is related to Bhagvan is the one that was adopted by Narad, the Sanakadik, Shukji, Dhruv, Prahlad, and Ambrish. It is this dharma that is known as bhagvat dharma or ekantik dharma. In fact, this type of dharma is not different from bhakti; they are both one. The type of dharma that avatars of Bhagvan come to establish is this very same dharma. On the other hand, the dharma of a person's varna and ashram alone is extremely inferior compared to bhagvat dharma, because it is through bhagvat dharma that the jeev crosses Bhagvan's Maya and attains the dham of Purushottam. Therefore, the status of bhagvat dharma and bhakti is the same, and the rewards of both are exactly the same as well; so, the greatness of bhakti and dharma are the same. In comparison, the dharma of a person's varna and ashram on its own is extremely weak, and its rewards are temporary."
21.6 Shreeji Maharaj then continued, "In my opinion, even if I try to develop affection for anyone other than Bhagvan and His ekantik bhaktas, I cannot do so. I also feel that my strength is similar to that of Jadbharat, Shukdevji, Dattatrey, and Rushabh- Dev Bhagvan. As a result, I also prefer to stay only in forests, mountains, and jungles; I do not like to stay in large towns or cities. This is my inherent nature. Despite this, I stay in the midst of thousands of people for the sake of Bhagvan and His bhaktas. However, I remain just as detached here as I would if I were living in the forests. I do not stay amidst thousands of people out of any self-interest; it is for the sake of Bhagvan and His bhaktas that I stay in the midst of people. No matter how much pravrutti I may have to engage myself in for the sake of the bhaktas of Bhagvan, I still consider it to be nivrutti.
21.7 "Moreover, I do not see the flaws of a bhakta of Bhagvan, however much at fault he may be. I believe that even if there are some intrinsic, minor flaws in a bhakta of Bhagvan, a person should overlook them. However, if those flaws are in himself, then he should make an effort to eradicate them. Also, if that type of flaw appears in a bhakta of Bhagvan, he should not take note of that flaw. A person should perceive flaws in a bhakta only if he were to lapse in his observance of some major vartman, but not on account of some other minor flaw.
21.8 "A person should also not be pleased by defeating a bhakta of Bhagvan in arguments. Instead, he should derive pleasure in deliberately losing to him. A person who does engage in an argument and defeats a bhakta of Bhagvan is a sinner worse than someone who has committed the five great sins.
21.9 "In addition, I do not like even the sight of a person who speaks unkindly of a bhakta of Bhagvan before me. In fact, I do not enjoy food or water offered by a person who perceives flaws in a bhakta of Bhagvan. If he does do so, then even if he happens to be my relative, I still develop an intense dislike for him. This is because in reality, we are the atma; so, why should we keep affection for our body and the relatives of the body? We have developed affection for Bhagvan and His bhaktas believing ourselves to be an atma, not out of the belief that we are the body.
21.10 "The inner enemies, such as kam, krodh, lobh, moh, will certainly distress a person who is unable to behave as the atma. Therefore, if a person offers bhakti without attaining atma- nishtha, his true nature is sure to be exposed in this satsang. This is because this satsang is alokik, and all these satsangis are exactly like Bhagvan's parshads residing in Shvet-Dvip, Vaikunth, and Golok. I take oath on Bhagvan and His bhaktas that I realise these satsangis to be the same as the parshads of Bhagvan residing in the divya Akshardham.
21.11 "However, a person whose gnan, vairagya, dharma, and bhakti are not extremely firm will most certainly fall back in satsang. For example, a thread dipped in wax remains stiff in winter and monsoon, but when summer comes, it becomes loose. In the same way, monsoon and winter represent the period when the bhaktas here are happy in every way and are also honoured in satsang. During that period, gnan, vairagya, dharma, and bhakti appear to be very intense. However, with the arrival of summer – the period when a bhakta is insulted in satsang or when he becomes physically distressed – his gnan, vairagya, dharma, and bhakti become loose like the thread dipped in wax. Even then, I do not abandon such a person. However, he becomes obliged to leave satsang of his own accord. Then, even if he is supposedly a satsangi, he does not experience the bliss of satsang within.
21.12 "For this reason, a person should practise satsang with intense firmness after attaining atma- nishtha; he should not practise satsang in such a way that affection for his body and his relatives persists. To continue the analogy, a thread of gold remains the same in all six seasons; it does not become loose even during the heat of summer. Similarly, when a person's satsang is firm, regardless of the amount of misery that he may encounter, and however many times he is insulted in satsang, his mind never turns away from satsang. Only such loyal satsangi Vaishnavs are my relatives; and I wish to stay in Krishna Bhagvan's dham. This is my decision, and all of you should also make the same decision.
21.13 "I say this because as you have all become my ashrit, I should tell you that which is beneficial to you. After all, a true friend is a person who tells us that which benefits us, even if it may appear to be hurtful. Please realise this as the characteristic of a true friend."

Gadhada III – 22
Loving Bhakti
22.1 In the Samvat year 1884, on Bhadarva vad 4 [9th September 1827], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Tassels of white flowers were hanging from his pagh, and garlands of white flowers were hanging around His neck. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some paramhans were singing a vishnupad to the accompaniment of a dukad and saroda. Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in the sabha with antar- drashti.
22.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The strength of profound, loving bhakti in a bhakta of Bhagvan, as described in this kirtan, is the strength of Jhina-Bhai, and it was the strength of Parvat-Bhai and Mulji Brahm-Chari as well. While keeping antar-drashti, I was thinking that there must also be others in this satsang with the same strength. A person who develops this strength of profound, loving bhakti loses all attachment to the panch-vishays and is able to maintain atma- nishtha without even having to try."
22.3 Then, Muktanand Swami asked, "Narsinh Mehta worshipped Shree Krishna Bhagvan with a sense of friendship, whereas many bhaktas of Bhagvan, such as Narad, worshipped Bhagvan with seva. Of these two types of bhaktas, whose bhakti should be regarded as being better?"
22.4 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The type of bhakti offered by Narsinh Mehta, the gopis, Narad, and the Sanakadik is not of two types; in reality, it is of one type. After all, the body – be it male or female – is worldly and perishable. However, the jeevatma, the worshipper, is neither male nor female, but is chetan. When the jeevatma leaves its body and travels to the dham of Bhagvan, it assumes a svarup according to the wish of Bhagvan; or, depending upon the opportunity for seva that arises there, that bhakta assumes an appropriate svarup and performs the seva of Bhagvan accordingly.
22.5 "However, if a bhakta of Bhagvan develops the same attachment to wealth, women and other objects as he has towards Bhagvan, then he cannot be called a loyal bhakta of Bhagvan. Having become a bhakta of Bhagvan, if a person commits sins and accumulates harmful desires in satsang itself while offering bhakti, then those sins become embedded in him – as if etched in iron. Moreover, a greater sin than associating with the wife of another man due to the influence of evil company is to look at a bhakta of Bhagvan lustfully while in satsang. Therefore, a person who wishes to develop deep attachment to Bhagvan should not allow any type of sin to remain in his mind. This is because female satsangi bhaktas are to be viewed as a person's own mother, sister, or daughter. Those who look at women of their own family lustfully are the extremely evil sinners in this world. So, a person who looks at bhaktas lustfully is an evil sinner and will never be released from that sin. That is why a person who wishes to become a rasik bhakta should become a rasik bhakta after avoiding this kind of sin.
22.6 "Having said this, the greatest of all sins is perceiving faults in Bhagvan and His bhaktas, because due to that fault-finding attitude, hatred is created towards them. Even if a person has killed millions of cows, consumed alcohol and meat, and committed adultery with the wife of his guru countless times, he can still be released from such sins at some time or other. However, a person who insults Bhagvan and His bhaktas will never be released from his sin. Then, if the person insulting Bhagvan and His bhaktas is a male, he will become a male demon; or if female, she will become a female demon. Then, even after countless lives, that person will never stop being a demon and will never become a bhakta of Bhagvan.
22.7 "Furthermore, a person who has already insulted a bhakta of Bhagvan and whose insulting attitude has become established will under no circumstances be able to eradicate that attitude. On the other hand, another person who is in the process of insulting, realises, 'I have committed a great sin by insulting Bhagvan and His bhaktas; therefore I am extremely evil, and Bhagvan and His bhaktas are extremely great'. When a person sees the qualities of others and sees faults within himself in this way, then any sins he may have committed will be eradicated, however great they may be.
22.8 "No other sin displeases and hurts Bhagvan more than the sin of insulting His bhaktas. When Jay and Vijay insulted the Sanakadik in Vaikunth, Bhagvan immediately rushed to the Sanakadik and told them, 'Whoever insults sadhus like you is my enemy. Therefore, you have done well in giving a curse to Jay and Vijay. In fact, if my own hand were to harm brahmans like you, then even I would cut off my hand; so what can I say to others?' This is what Vishnu Bhagvan said to the Sanakadik. As a result, Jay and Vijay became demons due to the sin of insulting the devout bhaktas of Bhagvan. Others who have also insulted bhaktas of Bhagvan have all fallen from their high position – a fact that is well noted in the shastras. Therefore, a person who desires the best for himself should not insult the bhaktas of Bhagvan. If a person does happen to knowingly or unknowingly insult someone, then he should bow at that person's feet, pray to him, and act in a way that pleases him."

Gadhada III – 23
Mansi Puja
23.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on the night of aso sud Punam [22nd October 1828], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed in the yard of His residence in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
23.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj, out of compassion, addressed all the bhaktas and said, "A person who is a bhakta of Bhagvan daily performs the mansi puja of Bhagvan. A person should perform that mansi puja in different ways, depending on the three seasons: summer, winter, and monsoon.
23.3 "During the four months of summer, a person should perform puja by first bathing Bhagvan with cool, fragrant, pure water. He should then offer Him a beautiful, washed, thin, white khes to wear. After seating Bhagvan on a beautiful seat, His whole body should be smeared with fragrant sandalwood from the Malay mountains, which has been collected in a bowl after forming it into a paste. Firstly, the sandalwood paste should be smeared on His forehead and closely observed; then the paste should be smeared on His chest, stomach, thighs, calves, and other parts of His body. Those parts should also be observed. Then, beautiful kum-kum should be applied on His holy feet as well as on the soles of His feet, and they too should then be observed. Then, garlands of fragrant flowers, such as mogra, chameli, champa, and roses, as well as various jewellery, and bajubandh and berkha made of flowers should be offered. A fine cloth that is not too heavy and is as white as a mogra flower should be tied around His head; and a beautiful, white cloth which is fine and light, should be wrapped around His body. Then, he should embrace Bhagvan – once, or twice, or according to the degree of his love. Then, he should touch Bhagvan's holy feet to his own chest and head. During the embrace, the sandalwood paste on Bhagvan's body, as well as parts of the garlands of flowers, may stick to his own body; and kum-kum may also stick as a result of touching Bhagvan's holy feet to his own chest and head. All this should be visualised, and he should feel, 'Sandalwood paste, kum-kum, and garlands blessed by Bhagvan have touched my body!'
23.4 "During the four months of winter, a person should perform puja by first bathing Bhagvan with warm water, and then offering Him a white khes to wear. He should then seat Bhagvan on a decorated bedstead with a velvet mattress that has been covered with a white sheet. He should offer a surval, offer a dagli, tie a rich orange reto of golden threads around His head, tie a rich reto around His waist, and place a rich reto over His shoulders. Then, he should place various types of jewellery made of diamonds, pearls, gold, and rubies on various parts of His body, and also a pearl necklace. After offering these clothes and jewellery, the various parts of Bhagvan's body should be closely observed. A kum-kum chandlo should also be applied to Bhagvan's forehead.
23.5 "During the four months of monsoon, a person should perform puja imagining that Bhagvan has returned from some village, and His white clothes have become completely drenched; or that He had gone to bathe with the paramhans in a river and has returned from there completely drenched. After removing His wet clothes, He should be offered deep orange garments to wear, and His forehead should be smeared with yellow sandalwood paste mixed with saffron.
23.6 "During summer, a person should visualise Bhagvan to be sitting either in an open place or in a flower garden. During winter and monsoon, he should visualise Bhagvan to be seated in a medi, or inside a house. In particular, when offering Bhagvan something to eat, only those foods – that are chewed, drunk, licked, or sucked – which he likes to eat should be visualised for offering to Bhagvan. Even if Bhagvan does not like these foods, when offering items to Him, a person should still visualise only those items that he enjoys himself. Also, incense, oil lamps, flowers, and arti should be offered to Bhagvan as appropriate.
23.7 "In this way, a bhakta who offers puja in different ways according to the three different seasons increases his love for Bhagvan, and his jeev benefits tremendously. Therefore, whoever has heard this talk should remember it and daily perform the mansi puja of Bhagvan in the way described. As a matter of fact, I have never talked about this before."
23.8 Shreeji Maharaj then spoke on another topic. He said, "When Bhagvan and His bhaktas are pleased on a bhakta, he should feel, 'It is my great fortune that Bhagvan and His bhaktas are pleased with me'. Also, when they lecture him, for the purpose of teaching a lesson, he should feel, 'It is my great fortune that they lecture me; after all, it will help in removing my flaws'. In this way, a person should be pleased even if lectured; he should not feel any grief in his mind, nor get upset, nor even regard himself as being very sinful. He should always remain pleased. This attitude should always be remembered."

Gadhada III – 24
Sixteen Spiritual Activities - Vairagya Due To Gnan
24.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on aso vad 12 [4th November 1828], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting in the mandir of Shree Gopinathji in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sadhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
24.2 Then, Muktanand Swami asked Shreeji Maharaj, "The bhaktas remain in Bhagvan's seva in Akshardham. What are the spiritual activities needed to earn such seva?"
24.3 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "An ekantik bhakta easily earns Bhagvan's seva in Akshardham through sixteen spiritual activities: shraddha; svadharma; vairagya; total control over the indriyas; ahinsa; brahm-charya; keeping the company of sadhus; atma- nishtha; unwavering bhakti to Bhagvan coupled with the knowledge of His greatness; happiness; honesty; compassion; penance; treating senior bhaktas with greater qualities as gurus and also maintaining deep respect for them; maintaining a feeling of friendship towards those bhaktas who are his equal; and treating those bhaktas who are junior to him as a shishya and acting for their benefit."
24.4 Shuk Muni then asked, "All of our sadhus observe vartmans. But, what characteristic in a sadhu would enable us to be sure that the sadhu would never deviate from his dharma even in times of difficulty?"
24.5 Shreeji Maharaj answered, "A sadhu whose attention is constantly focused on all of those agnas given by Bhagvan, whether they are major or minor; and who finds it extremely difficult to disobey any agna; and who acts neither excessively nor in a careless way regarding those agnas, should be known as a person who would not fall from his dharma despite difficult circumstances."
24.6 Shreeji Maharaj then spoke out of compassion: "It is very difficult for a person to eradicate his svabhav. Regardless of this, if he has realised that satsang fulfils his self-interest, then it is not difficult to do so. For example, the members of Dada Khachar's family have an interest in keeping me here, so they do not retain any svabhav that I do not like. In this way, a person's svabhav can be eradicated due to self-interest. It can also be eradicated out of fear, although not totally. This is because a person may fear someone in his presence, but when that person is not present, he may no longer be fearful – just as a thief abandons his corrupt nature due to fear of the king.
24.7 "Furthermore, despite the fact that I have repeatedly fired harsh words and upset a person who possesses some svabhav or another, if he is not disheartened in any way at all, then I have such love for that person that the love remains effortlessly as it is, in the jagrat state and svapna state. Regardless of whatever happens, that love does not diminish.
24.8 "Moreover, of the various gun possessed by bhaktas, I shall now narrate one admirable gun in each bhakta. Dada Khachar – gun of faith; Raj-Bai – gun of tyag; Jeevu-Ba – gun of shraddha, Ladu-Ba – gun of desiring to please me; Nityanand Swami – gun of desiring to please me; Brahmanand Swami – gun of insisting that there should be no lapse at all in observing the niyams of satsang; Muktanand Swami – gun of desiring to please me and having faith in me; Somla Khachar – gun of always behaving consistently; Chaitanyanand Swami – gun of wishing to behave in such a way that pleases Maharaj in any way; Svayamprakashanand Swami – gun of nishchay in Bhagvan and realising His greatness; Jhina-Bhai Thakor – gun of having awareness, for fear that he becomes attached to any object other than Bhagvan; and Mota atmanand Swami – gun of ensuring that none of my agnas are disobeyed." In this way, Shreeji Maharaj narrated the gun of many senior paramhans and other bhaktas.
24.9 He then continued, "The three senior ladies of this place (Raj-Bai, Jeevu-Ba, and Ladu-Ba), and Gopalanand Swami, Brahmanand Swami, Muktanand Swami, Nityanand Swami, Shuk Muni, Somla Khachar, and Dada Khachar – all of you presently behave very well. However, if the four factors of desh, kal, kriya, and sang were to become unpleasant, then there is no doubt at all that your enthusiasm would not remain as it is now. However, if a person who has a great degree of gnan were to be caught in the vishays, he would break free from that attachment. This gnan is the understanding, 'I, the jeev, am like this; the body is like this; the relations of the body are like this; the nature of Prakruti, Purush, virat, sutratma, and avyakrut is like this; Bhagvan is like this; and the dham of Bhagvan is like this', and so on. If a person has firm belief of this gnan in his heart, then the vairagya that results is true vairagya. Apart from that, any other form of vairagya only superficially appears to be vairagya; in fact, there is no strength in it. For example, the flame of an oil lamp is extinguished by the wind, whereas the vadvanal fire and fire of lightning in the clouds is not extinguished by water; despite remaining in water itself, it continues to burn. In the same way, vairagya without gnan does not last when it encounters the vishays. On the other hand, vairagya produced from gnan does not diminish despite encountering the vishays; it continues to burn like the vadvanal fire.
24.10 "It is precisely for the purpose of somehow instilling this gnan in your minds that I continuously deliver talks. If a talk eventually does truly inspire you, then this gnan will become instilled in you. On the other hand, if a person does not understand this and instead has a sense of 'I-ness' and 'my-ness' by believing, 'This is my varna, this is my mother, this is my father, these are my relatives', then he should be known to be an extremely ignorant person with a worldly perception."
24.11 Having said this, Shreeji Maharaj again spoke out of compassion: "What is the reason behind a mumukshu attaining noble qualities? Well, a person develops hatred for the world in proportion to the attachment he has for listening to the talks and kathas of Bhagvan. Also, vicious natures, such as kam, krodh, lobh, and moh, are also destroyed to that extent. Conversely, if a person is lazy in listening to those talks and kathas, then he should assume that he will not remember noble shastras. In fact, out of the nine types of bhakti mentioned in the shastras, the bhakti of listening to kathas is considered to be the best. Therefore, a person who possesses that form of bhakti will attain all the various forms of bhakti up to the including profound, loving bhakti." Shreeji Maharaj delivered the talk in this way.
24.12 At noon on that same day, when all the paramhans were seated for their meals in a line on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar, Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed under the neem tree.
24.13 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said to the paramhans, "A person should not understand the greatness of female bhaktas in excess. This is because under the excuse of realising their greatness, he may constantly think of them, leading to them appearing in his dreams. So, if a person does understand their greatness, he should understand it collectively, by thinking, 'All of them are bhaktas of Bhagvan'. However, he should not attempt to understand a particular bhakta as being greater and another bhakta being lesser. If he attempts to understand their greatness to a greater or lesser degree than this, then there is a great danger in that. Similarly, female bhaktas should also understand the greatness of male bhaktas collectively. If they do not realise this, then it is also a great danger for those females."

Gadhada III – 25
Raj-Bai's Question
25.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Kartik sud 10 [16th November 1828], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
25.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj spoke out of compassion: "Bhakti, upasana, seva, shraddha, firmness in observing dharma, and other spiritual activities related to Bhagvan should all be performed without having desires for any rewards. This fact is mentioned in the sacred shastras, and it is true; but, a person should certainly have the following desire: 'May Bhagvan become pleased with me through these activities'. That desire should be kept. On the other hand, if a person does not keep such a desire and acts without any specific purpose, then he should be known to possess tamo-gun. Therefore, a person should develop the qualities of bhakti, upasana, seva, shraddha, and dharma with the desire for rewards in the form of the happiness of Bhagvan. If a person has any desire other than that, he will attain only rewards such as the four types of mukti.
25.3 "Furthermore, it is not the case that Bhagvan's happiness is bestowed only on those who offer bhakti with various items and not upon the poor. Someone may be poor, but if he offers water, leaves, fruits, and flowers to Bhagvan with shraddha, that is enough to please Him. This is because Bhagvan is extremely great. Just as a king rewards someone who composes even a verse in his praise with a village, similarly, Bhagvan also becomes pleased instantly."
25.4 Continuing, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Who can be called a true bhakta of Bhagvan? If some prolonged illness were to overtake a person's body; or if he receives neither food to eat nor any clothes to wear; or regardless of the extent of pain or pleasure that come his way, if he still does not fall back even slightly from the worship of bhakti of Bhagvan, niyams, dharma, or shraddha, but progresses with time, then he is called a true bhakta."
25.5 Then, Raj-Bai had a question asked to Shreeji Maharaj, "Which gun pleases you, and which avgun displeases you?"
25.6 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "The following are the avgun of speech: If someone wishes to behave in some special way, then he should notify me only once by saying: 'Maharaj, if you agree, then I shall behave like this'. I do not like it when a person repeatedly asks, 'Maharaj, why are you not telling me whether I should behave like this or behave like that?' I do not like a person who, despite knowing me as his ishtadev, repeatedly questions my words. I do not like a person who interrupts me while I am speaking to someone. Regarding the performance of religious actions, such as performing dhyan upon Bhagvan, observance of dharma, offering bhakti, I do not like a person who throws the burden of such actions on Bhagvan by thinking, 'Only if Bhagvan wishes are these possible'. Also, I do not like a person who thinks, 'I shall do this; and I shall do that', and then relies only on his own strength and not on the strength of Bhagvan. I extremely dislike a person who speaks inconsistently and rudely. I do not like a person who feels a sense of shame or laziness when it comes to talking of Bhagvan, listening to kathas, or singing kirtans, and yet feels no shame or laziness in performing worldly activities. Also, I do not like a person who boasts of his tyag or bhakti, or of anything else. I do not like a person who sits behind everyone else during a sabha instead of sitting as suits his own status. Moreover, when seniors are seated in a sabha, I do not like a person who forcibly pushes them aside to take his own place at the front of the sabha.
25.7 "In addition, I am pleased with female bhaktas who behave morally by covering their own bodies and who keep their gaze cast downwards when they walk, instead of keeping a wandering gaze. Many times, instead of doing my darshan with a fixed gaze, someone may abandon that darshan and look repeatedly in the direction of an approaching man or woman, or a dog walking by, or cattle walking by, or in the direction of some noise. On such a person, I feel so much disgust that I feel, 'What can I do? If I had not become a sadhu, I would beat him in some way!' But, that is not possible since beating someone is extremely inappropriate for a sadhu. I also do not like a person who conceals the truth – who does not reveal the disturbing thoughts that arise in his mind to an appropriate person. Also, these three things are extremely harmful: man, krodh, and being so suppressed by others that what is in the mind cannot be revealed. Also, if bhaktas become disrespectful because they view each other as equals and do not maintain respect for one another, that is also extremely inappropriate."

Gadhada III – 26
A Sant Who Is Worthy Of Seva Equally To Bhagvan
26.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Kartik sud 11 [17th November 1828], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in the mandir of Shree Gopinathji in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
26.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked, "What are the characteristics of a sant who is worthy of seva equally to Bhagvan? Well, such a sant suppresses the actions of Maya's gun ( sattva-gun, rajo-gun, and tamo-gun), such as the indriyas and the antah-karans; but, he himself does not get suppressed by their actions. In addition to this, he only performs activities related to Bhagvan; he is loyal in his observance of the panch- vartman; and believing himself to be brahm-rup, he worships Purushottam Bhagvan. Such a sant should not be thought of as a human being, nor should he be thought of as a dev, because such behaviour is not possible for either humans or devs. In reality, even though that sant appears to be human, he is still worthy of seva equally to Bhagvan. Therefore, whoever desires to attain kalyan should perform the seva of such sant. Also, females should perform seva of females possessing such qualities."
26.3 Then, atmanand Swami asked Shreeji Maharaj, "Regardless of how ordinary a person may be, as long as he stays within the limits of the vartmans of this satsang, he will not become bound by the panch-vishays. Please narrate the characteristics of a person who cannot become bound by the panch-vishays, even though he may happen to leave satsang due to unpleasant circumstances."
26.4 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "If a person has dharma predominant in his mind; and if he has the qualities of an astik where he firmly believes, 'A person who performs moral and immoral karmas in this lok will undoubtedly receive the rewards of those karmas in the lok beyond'; and if he has such firm beliefs, and is concerned about his own reputation by thinking, 'If I do something immoral, what will people think of me?', then he will not become bound by any object wherever he goes. For example, those like Maya-Ram Bhatt, Mulji Brahm-Chari, and Nishkulanand Swami will never falter even if they encounter women or wealth.
26.5 "However, a person who is like this may have the characteristics of false atma- nishtha in thinking, 'I am the atma; I am brahm; so, I am not affected by good or bad actions, and I am absolutely detached from everything'. Also, he may falsely understand the greatness of Bhagvan, and he may talk a great deal about that greatness, by saying, 'The greatness of Bhagvan is so intense! So, what harm is there in deviating from dharma?' In such a person, these two types of flaws could become major obstacles in the observance of dharma. Therefore, it is better if he has genuine atma- nishtha, if he thoroughly understands the greatness of Bhagvan, and if he firmly observes the various types of dharma with understanding, and becomes nishkami, nirlobhi, nisvadi, nisnehi, and nirmani in order to please Bhagvan. Such a person believes, 'If I follow dharma, Bhagvan will be extremely pleased with me; and if I deviate from dharma in any way, then Bhagvan will be extremely displeased with me'. If he has this firm belief, then that bhakta will never falter from dharma in any way. On the other hand, if a person does not have this kind of understanding, then regardless of how much gnan he may have, or how much bhakti he may offer, he may still deviate from dharma or become bound by mayik objects. This is a fundamental truth."
26.6 Shreeji Maharaj again addressed the sabha out of compassion: "I do not like ahankar. That ahankar may be of a person's qualities of bhakti, tyag, or vairagya; of a person's attainment of the qualities of brahm; of a person's understanding; or of a person's observance of the panch- vartman. I do not like these or any other forms of ahankar. Also, I do not like dambh. What is dambh? Well, although a person may not have much nishchay, bhakti, or dharma, to outwardly pretend to possess them to a great extent in order to look good in front of others is dambh. I do not like that; and nor do I like a person who eliminates the difference between himself and Bhagvan. I also do not like a person who behaves freely liberally – after taking a vow, he adheres to it occasionally and relaxes from it occasionally. In addition, I do not like a person who considers himself to be extremely insignificant after having extensively understood the intense glory of Bhagvan, and who does not believe his true svarup to be the atma, which is distinct from the body.
26.7 "Now, I shall describe the type of person I do like. Such a person thoroughly understands the greatness of Bhagvan. He understands his atma – which is vyatirek from the body – to be brahm-rup. He firmly observes dharma and also engages in the bhakti of Bhagvan. Despite having such qualities, if there is some bhakta in satsang who does not understand anything, but has nishchay in Bhagvan, then he would consider that bhakta to be great, and himself to be insignificant in comparison to that bhakta. When speaking, such a person never reveals even the slightest pride of his wisdom. I am extremely pleased with a person who behaves in this way."
26.8 Having delivered this talk, Shreeji Maharaj returned to His residence.

Gadhada III – 27
All Bliss Is Found In The Murti Of Bhagvan
27.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Kartik sud Punam [21st November 1828], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in the mandir of Shree Gopinathji in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
27.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The pleasures associated with shabda, sparsh, rup, ras, and gandh, are all found to exist together in one place – in the blissful and divya murti of Purushottam Bhagvan. When we have the darshan of that murti of Bhagvan, we can enjoy the bliss of that beauty, as well as the bliss of the other four types of vishays, all at the same time. However, with worldly vishays, when a person indulges in one vishay, he receives the pleasure of only that vishay, but not of the others. Therefore, the pleasures of worldly vishays are found separately. Moreover, those pleasures are useless, perishable, and the cause of extreme misery. However, in Bhagvan, a person enjoys the bliss of all the vishays at the same time. That bliss is extremely divya; it is eternal and imperishable. Therefore, a mumukshu should develop vairagya towards the worldly vishays and become totally attached to the divya and blissful murti of Bhagvan."
27.3 Shreeji Maharaj then continued, "If a bhakta has an intense desire to engage in the bhakti of Bhagvan and to associate with His sant, then regardless of any svabhav that he may possess, he eradicates it and behaves according to the sant's wishes. Even if that svabhav is such that it has become bound to the chaitanya, a person who has an intense desire to do satsang will eradicate it." With that, He narrated His own story: "Initially, my nature was like that of a tyagi, but because I had an intense desire for the darshan of Ramanand Swami, I lived according to Muktanand Swami's instructions, and not according to my personal preferences."
27.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The details of the kind of determination a bhakta should and should not keep are as follows: The first type of determination is observing the vows, such as nishkami and nirlobhi; the second type of determination is behaving with the feeling that he will be able to sleep only if his place is here and not if it is elsewhere. The second type and other innumerable forms of determination that are the result of insignificant svabhavs should not be considered the same as the first type of determination. The determination of observing vartmans is an essential as a person's own life; it is extremely beneficial. That type of determination should be kept with an understanding of its importance. But, if the second type of determination is formed, which is due to svabhavs, it should be thought of as worthless; and if a sant asks a person to abandon it, then it should be abandoned. However, the first type of determination should not be abandoned.
27.5 "To consider these two forms of determination as equivalent is foolishness. For example, if a child has almonds in his fist, and if someone attempts to make him give them up, he will not. Furthermore, if he has a fist full of rupees or a fist full of gold coins, and if someone attempts to make him give them up, he will not give them up. Therefore, it can be said that the child considers the almonds, and rupees, and the gold coins to be of equal value. Therefore, the child can be considered to be ignorant.
27.6 "If someone has almonds in his hand, and a thief comes and threatens him by saying, 'Put them down, or I will cut off your head with this sword', then a person who is wise will give them away, but a person who is foolish will not. Similarly, between the two types of determination, a person should realise which is significant and which is insignificant. If someone does not understand this and considers both to be equivalent, then he should be known to have a svabhav of stubbornness and arrogance. If such a person does observe the vartmans due to that determination, and if he remains in satsang in this way till the end, then it is all well and good; but a person cannot have complete faith in him. This is because if he is offended by some remarks, or if his self-importance is not maintained, then he will not remain as he is. On the other hand, a person who offers bhakti to Bhagvan and observes vartmans with determination is called a rajarshi; and a person who offers bhakti to Bhagvan while observing vartmans with the intention of pleasing Bhagvan is called a brahmarshi and a sadhu. There is a similar difference in the rewards of the two as well."
27.7 Continuing, Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The flaws of man, irshya, and krodh are much more harmful than even kam. This is because a sant may have compassion on a person with kam, but he will not have compassion on person with man. In addition, irshya and krodh evolve from man. Therefore, man is a major flaw. Furthermore, a person does not fall from satsang due to kam as he does due to man. For example, there are many grahastha bhaktas in our satsang, and they continue to remain in satsang. So, I always have an intense dislike for man, irshya, and krodh. You will find this verified in my spoken words which have been written down. Also, if you reflect upon them, then you will realise this to be true as well. Therefore, a person should eradicate man by realising the greatness of Bhagvan."
27.8 Again, Shreeji Maharaj said, "What is nishchay in Bhagvan? Well, consider how it is in worldly life. Since childhood, a person has the belief of his parents, varna, and ashram, and gender, as well as the belief that this is an animal, this is a man, this is water, this is fire, this is the earth, this is the wind, this is the sky, and so on. All this is due to the shastras. Even if a person has not heard the shastras, he has been convinced by principles prevalent in society, which themselves were derived from the shastras. Similarly, the characteristics of a sant, who is free of vicious natures like kam, lobh, man, svad, and moh, are also described in the shastras. A sant who possesses these characteristics has direct relationship with Bhagvan. Therefore, a person should develop nishchay in Bhagvan based on His words. In fact, to have firm faith in the words of the sant is itself nishchay in Bhagvan."
27.9 Then, Nath Bhakta of Vadodara asked Shreeji Maharaj a question: "Do the relatives of a bhakta of Bhagvan, who has firm nishchay in Bhagvan, attain kalyan due to their relationship with that bhakta?"
27.10 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "If the relatives or ancestors of a bhakta of Bhagvan have affection for him, then yes, they will attain kalyan; otherwise, they will not. In fact, even if a person who is not related to that bhakta has affection for him, then he will also benefit. This is because at the time of death, a person may remember that bhakta whose vrutti is constantly fixed on Bhagvan. Therefore, by remembering that bhakta, he attains kalyan."
27.11 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "I talk about the nature of the atma and about the nature of Bhagvan. However, by merely talking about them a person does not experience their bliss as it really is. Their true bliss can only be experienced in samadhi, or after a person leaves his body; but it cannot be experienced by merely talking about it. For example, the pleasure of looking at an attractive object can only be enjoyed by the eyes. If someone were to praise that pleasure with his mouth by saying, 'I saw a very beautiful object', then the pleasure experienced by the mouth is not the same as that experienced by the eyes. Similarly, a person may attempt to praise with words the pleasure of sounds heard by the ears, fragrances smelt by the nose, sensations felt by the skin, and flavours tasted by the tongue, by saying, 'It was an extremely pleasant smell; it had a delicious taste; it felt very good; it sounded nice'. However, he does not experience pleasure through words as he experiences pleasure through the indriyas.
27.12 Similarly, the bliss and the happiness of Bhagvan that he experiences, as well as the bliss and the happiness of the atma that he experiences through samadhi or after leaving the body, cannot be experienced by merely talking about them. However, if a person performs shravan, manan, and nididhyas on these two topics, then he attains sakshatkar. Then, after attaining sakshatkar, he enjoys the same experience and bliss as he does from these two in samadhi. Therefore, after listening to talks concerning these two, a person should perform manan and nididhyas on those talks."

Gadhada III – 28
Falling From The Path Of Bhagvan's
28.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Kartik vad 1 [22nd November 1828], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in the mandir of Shree Gopinathji in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
28.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "There are two ways in which a person falls from the bhakti of Bhagvan. One way is by listening to shushka- vedanti shastras, where he may consider the svarup of Shree Krishna Bhagvan and other svarups to be false, just as he considers all other svarups to be false. Such a shushka- vedanti should be considered to be extremely ignorant. The other way of falling is by believing, 'If I worship Bhagvan, then I will enjoy women, food, drink, and other pleasures of the panch-vishays in Golok and Vaikunth'. Then, due to the desires of those pleasures, he forgets even Bhagvan. The fool, with his distorted mind, believes, 'If that enjoyment was not true, then Bhagvan would not associate with women like Radha and Lakshmi, in that dham. So, that pleasure is also true'. However, he does not realise Bhagvan to be absolutely satisfied and happy within His own atma. In actual fact, such activities of Bhagvan are for the purpose of giving bliss to His own bhaktas. Therefore, a person should engage in bhakti together with gnan and vairagya.
28.3 "A person who has understood the greatness of Bhagvan realises that only Bhagvan is all-blissful, whereas the pleasures derived from the panch-vishays have only a slight fraction of the bliss of Bhagvan. Therefore, he would never become attached to any object. The Moksh-Dharma also mentions: 'Compared to the bliss of the dham of Bhagvan, the pleasures of the other loks are like Narak'. This is the understanding that a bhakta of Bhagvan should have. If he does not have this understanding, he will fall away from Bhagvan in the two ways mentioned."
28.4 Then, Sura Khachar asked Shreeji Maharaj, "Even after forming firm nishchay in Bhagvan and His sant as they truly are, what is the reason for someone to suffer a setback?"
28.5 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "There was some deficiency in that person's nishchay from the moment that he first established it. What was that deficiency? Well, if someone wishes to indulge in savoury food due to a desire for tasting delicious food, and if Bhagvan or His sant criticise it, then he will suffer a setback. Or, if disturbing thoughts of kam still remain, and they speak against it; or if lobh remains, and if they have him criticise his lobh by telling him, 'Give away your wealth, property, land, and farm to someone', then he will be unable to follow this agna. As a result, he suffers a setback. Or, if a person has man and a sant criticises it and insults him, then he suffers a setback due to that as well. Therefore, a person suffers a setback due to the avgun that still remain in him, even though he has nishchay in Bhagvan. However, if a person eradicates his avgun at the beginning, when he establishes his nishchay, then he will not suffer a setback. At present, if those who possess these avgun thoughtfully keep antar-drashti, they will be able to realise, 'I am weak in this aspect. So, if I am asked to follow such an agna I will fall back from satsang and become a vimukh'. In this way, they can understand themselves completely."
28.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked Brahmanand Swami, Shuk Muni, and Sura Khachar a question: "What avgun do you possess which would cause you to suffer a setback?"
28.7 The three of them answered, "Maharaj, we have the avgun of man. As a result, if a sadhu of an equal status to us insults us, we become somewhat disturbed."
28.8 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj commented, "A person may have realised Bhagvan with the knowledge of His greatness as mentioned in the shlok: dyupataya eva ten a yayur-antam anantataya tvamapi yad-antaranda-nichaya nanu savaranaha : Even the masters of the higher loks cannot understand your greatness, because it is endless. Neither can you yourself understand your own greatness. In your each and every hair, countless brahmands and their barriers (jad prakruti) fly simultaneously at immense speed – like specks of dust flying in the air. Even the Shrutis, ultimately perish in you, and fail to praise your glory. "If a person has realised Bhagvan in this way, then how can he keep man, irshya, or krodh towards a sadhu of such a Bhagvan? If he still does, then there is a flaw in his understanding. For example, if a person understands the authority of a governor – that he is the ruler of the whole world and that he is extremely powerful – then even if one of his pauper-like servants were to come, even a great king would obey his orders and act according to what he is told. This is because the king has understood, 'He is the servant of the powerful governor'. After all, a person's man does not continue in front of someone who is more powerful than himself. Similarly, if a person has understood Bhagvan to be the master of all divine powers and wealth, then how can he retain man before a sant?"
28.9 Brahmanand Swami agreed, "Maharaj, what you are saying is correct. If a person has realised Bhagvan and the knowledge of His greatness, then he will never develop man, irshya, or krodh towards a sant."
28.10 Shreeji Maharaj continued, "Uddhavji was so great and so intelligent. However, because he had understood the greatness of Bhagvan, he asked to be reborn as a vine so that he could be touched by the dust from the feet of the gopis who were greatly attached to Bhagvan. Therefore, it is stated: asam-ahe charana-renu-jusham-aham syam vrundavane kimapi gulma-latausha-dheenam ya dustyajam svajanam-arya-patham cha hitva bhejur-mukunda-padaveem shruti-bhir-vimru-gyam : Those gopis – having abandoned the bond of their bodily relations and the path of dharma as prescribed for the nobles – attained the state of Bhagvan, which even the Shrutis seek. May I also become any of the shrubs, vines, or herbs in Vrundavan that are touched by the dust of their feet. "Even Brahma has said, aho bhagyam-aho bhagyam nanda-gopa-vrajaukasam yan-mitram parama-nandam purnam brahma sanatanam : How fortunate is Nand, the cowherds, and the residents of Vraj – whose friend was the alokik, eternal, perfect, and blissful Bhagvan.
8.11 "As he had understood the greatness of Bhagvan, even Brahma spoke in this way. Therefore, if a person realises the greatness of Bhagvan and His sant in this way, man, irshya, or krodh can no longer persist. Moreover, he would behave as a das of das before them; and no matter however much they insult him, he would never think of leaving their company and going away. Also, he would never feel in his mind, 'How long should I tolerate this? I will just stay at home and engage in worship there'. Therefore, if a person understands Bhagvan's greatness in such a way, man is eradicated."
28.12 Then, Shreeji Maharaj explained, "If a bhakta of Bhagvan were placed on a shuli due to some karma of his, and if at that time I were standing next to him, the bhakta would still not think, 'It would be good if Bhagvan would free me from the pain of this shuli'. In this way, he is not concerned about his own physical comforts. Instead, he endures the difficulties that fall upon him. As a result, Bhagvan becomes extremely pleased with such a bhakta who is free of all expectations."
28.13 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "I shall now describe who attains the bliss related to Bhagvan. First, consider the following analogy: Water is the very life of a fish. As long as it remains in water, it is able to move, swim, and perform all its activities; but the moment it leaves the water, it loses its life and dies. Similarly, if a person believes the panch-vishays to be his lifeline and believes them to be a source of happiness, then when he is separated from them, he becomes almost like a dead person. Such a person can never attain the bliss of Bhagvan. In fact, only a person who does not believe the panch-vishays to be his lifeline experiences Bhagvan's bliss; only he is able to indulge in the bliss; and only he attains that bliss."

A Tyagi And Grahastha With Moderate Vairagya
29.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on the night of Posh sud 2 [7th January 1829], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead that had been placed on the platform in front of the medi in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sadhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
29.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked Shuk Muni a question: "Suppose there are two satsangis. Both are twenty years of age, and both possess nishchay, sneh, bhakti, vairagya, and dharma to an equal extent. However, due to prarabdha, one of them married, whereas the other did not find anyone and so remained a sankhya-yogi. He also had a desire to marry, but he could not find someone. Since neither of them had intense vairagya from the beginning, both have an intense desire for indulging in the vishays. Then, the question is whose desire will be calmed: the grahastha or the sankhya-yogi? When replying, keep in mind that the Veds state: 'Only a person who has intense vairagya should become a tyagi from the brahm-charya ashram; whereas a person whose vairagya is feeble should become a grahastha for the purpose of diminishing his intense desire to indulge in the vishays. Only then should he accept the vanprasth ashram, and then the sannyas ashram'. Therefore, answer carefully."
29.3 Shuk Muni attempted to answer the question but was unable to do so satisfactorily.
29.4 Answering the question Himself, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The grahastha is good, and the other who is a sankhya- yogi is bad. This is because he lacks intense vairagya. As a result, he does not realise that the vishays are worthless and false. Also, for the same reason, he has no firmness in his atma-nishtha. For this reason, if he happens to leave satsang and encounter vishays, he will become attached to them. However, if he does not come across vishays, he will be compelled to come back into satsang. On the other hand, the grahastha will progress even if he has the darshan of a sadhu once every six months. Therefore, it is not appropriate for a person who is deficient in vairagya to become a tyagi; it is only appropriate for someone who has intense vairagya. If someone who is deficient in vairagya does become a tyagi, then his tyag will not continue throughout his life. After one year, two years, or after even ten years, difficulties will definitely arise in his tyag."
29.5 Then, Shuk Muni raised a doubt. He questioned, "Maharaj, if the person whose vairagya is weak listens to the greatness of Bhagvan from a sadhu and thinks over it in his mind, then will he not develop intense vairagya? In fact, only very few people, due to their prarabdha, have intense vairagya from the beginning. Generally, we see that a person develops vairagya even though he did not possess it initially. How should this be understood?"
29.6 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "The answer to that is that a person can never develop intense vairagya merely by thinking by himself, or by any other means for that matter. However, if a person develops love for a great sant who possesses the four qualities of dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti, then all the actions he performs (seeing, listening, talking) will be performed according to the wishes of that great sant; he will not do anything which is against the sant's wish. In his mind, he constantly fears behaving against the wishes of that sant, and feels, 'If I do not behave according to his wish, then he will not maintain love for me'. That is why such a person will constantly behave according to the sant's wishes. Therefore, if someone has developed such attachment for a sant, then even if he does not have vairagya, his tyag will remain till the end.
29.7 "In our satsang, all the males, females, and paramhans, are attached to me. Also, all the females observe vartmans to the same extent as the three senior females (Ladu-Ba, Jeevu-Ba, and Raj-Bai). This is because in their mind, they realise, 'If we do not remain alert and observe the vartmans, the love which Maharaj has for us will not remain, and He will become unhappy'. The paramhans also behave in the same way. In fact, it is the same for all the other satsangis, brahm-charis and parshads. All the male and female bhaktas living far and wide are also alert in observing the vartmans; they too feel, 'If we do not behave properly, Maharaj will become displeased.' Therefore, all of them strictly observe dharma out of love for me, even though they may possess vairagya to a greater or lesser degree.
29.8 "However, when I recently fell ill in Panchala, if something serious had happened to me, then everyone's firmness would not have remained as it is now. At such a time, a person who has intense vairagya can remain within dharma; or a person who has lovingly attached his jeev to a person who has intense vairagya can remain within dharma; or a person who keeps contact with satsang and, realising Bhagvan to be antaryami, behaves according to the niyams that have been prescribed for him, can remain within dharma. Except for these, others cannot remain within dharma. Therefore, what I have just explained is the only answer to the question I had asked."

Constant Awareness Of Five Thoughts
30.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Posh sud Punam [19th January 1829], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in the mandir of Shree Gopinathji in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
30.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Two beliefs which I like, and by which my mind becomes calm, are as follows: First, I like a person who is firmly convinced that there is a mass of divine light which is chaitanya, and that the murti of Shree Purushottam Bhagvan forever resides at the centre of that mass of light; and with that belief, he worships and offers bhakti to that Bhagvan. On the other hand, I do not like a person who believes in and worships only the chaitanya divine light; nor do I like a person who does not believe Bhagvan to forever possess a svarup; nor do I like a person who does not worship Bhagvan. Secondly, I like a person who performs in tap, and yog, has vairagya and hatred towards the panch-vishays, in order to please Bhagvan – without any form of pretence. Seeing such a person, my mind becomes pleased, and I feel, 'He should be congratulated for behaving in that way'.
30.3 "In addition, I have constant awareness of these five thoughts: First, I am certainly going to die and leave this body. In fact, I firmly feel, 'I am going to die at this second, at this very moment'. Such awareness remains in times of happiness and distress, pleasure and displeasure, and amidst all activities. That is the type of vairagya I possess. The second thought is the constant awareness that even though death is certain, this much work is left, which I would like to complete. The third is thought of whether or not desires for the panch-vishays have been eradicated from my mind. I feel, 'If they have been eradicated, then why does activity regarding that vishay still occur? What if maybe they have not been eradicated?' In this way, I am constantly suspicious of the mind. The fourth thought is the concern of whether or not Muktanand Swami and the other senior sadhus and senior bhaktas have eradicated their desires for the panch-vishays. In fact, I am constantly aware of looking into everyone's hearts to observe, 'This person's worldly desires have been removed, but this person's have not'. Finally, the fifth thought is that if I become unhappy, then who knows where I would run away to! I would probably leave my body. Therefore, I believe I should not become unhappy. This is because it is good that by my association all these men, women, and paramhans happily sit to engage in the bhakti of Bhagvan. Seeing them engaged in such bhakti, I become extremely pleased in my mind. I feel, 'Everyone must die someday, but to perform bhakti in this way is the only great benefit of living'. I am constantly aware of this."
30.4 In this way, Shreeji Maharaj described His own behaviour as an example for the benefit of His bhaktas, while in actual fact, He Himself is the pratyaksha svarup of Shree Purushottam Narayan.

The Murti On Earth And The Murti In Akshardham
31.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on the evening of Maha sud 4 [7th February 1829], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He had tied a white feto around His head and was wearing a white khes. He had also covered Himself with a red-bordered, white, English cloth. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the paramhans were singing kirtans to the accompaniment of musical instruments.
31.2 After the paramhans sang the kirtan 'Hari Mere Haralaki Lakari...', Shreeji Maharaj requested, "Please sing 'Jamuna Ke Teer Thado...'." The paramhans then began singing that kirtan. In the meantime, Shreeji Maharaj sat thinking.
31.3 Then, He interrupted, "Please stop singing, and allow me to talk to you. What I am about to reveal to you is not much, but it can be very beneficial for those who practice dhyan. In fact, I have never revealed this matter before." Then, closing His gentle eyes, He began thinking, and then said, "There is a mass of divine light that is like countless millions of moons, suns, and flames of fire. That mass of light appears to be like an ocean. The svarup of Purushottam Bhagvan resides within that luminous, brahm-rup dham of Bhagvan, and He Himself assumes an avatar from that murti.
31.4 "What is that Bhagvan like? Well, He is greater than both the perishable and the imperishable; He is the cause of all causes; and countless millions of akshar-rup muktas worship His holy feet. Out of compassion, that very same Bhagvan is pratyaksha and present before your eyes in an incarnated murti for the purpose of granting ultimate kalyan of jeev s. Therefore, there is a great similarity between the murti residing in the dham of Bhagvan and this pratyaksha murti of Shree Krishna.
31.5 "The vision of a person who performs dhyan on this human murti of Shree Krishna develops extreme vairagya for all charming sights other than Bhagvan and remains engrossed only in the charm of Bhagvan. Then, he does not notice even the slightest difference between the pratyaksha murti of Bhagvan and the murti in His dham. The appearance and age of that murti, and the appearance and age of this murti will appear similar. In addition, the height and build of that murti will appear to be exactly the same as that of this murti; not even the slightest difference can be perceived between that murti and this murti. Also, there appears to be a total oneness between them. In this way, there is not even the slightest difference between that murti and this murti. In fact, both are one.
31.6 "When a person performs dhyan on that pratyaksha murti outwardly, in front of the eyes, there is not the slightest difference between that murti and this murti. However, if he looks at that same murti inwardly, within his eyes, then that same murti does not appear to be the same as before. In this case, it becomes the same size as the pupil of the eye. Then, when he performs dhyan and looks inward at the point of his throat and below, he does not see that same murti as the two murtis he saw before. He sees that same murti as being extremely large, extremely tall, extremely fat, and extremely frightening. For example, the shadow of a man formed by the sun at noon would be almost the same length as the man's body. But when that same sun sets, the shadow becomes very elongated – it does not remain the same length as the man's body. Similarly, the murti of Bhagvan also becomes as large as mentioned previously. Then, when the person sees that murti within the buddhi, which resides in the heart, and when he sees that murti within his own jeev within the buddhi, he sees the murti as being the size of a thumb. It appears to have two arms or four arms, but he does not see it in the three ways that he saw before. Then, while performing dhyan, he sees the murti to be greater than his jeev and sees it in the midst of a mass of divine light which is like that of countless millions of suns, moons, and flames of fire. Also, he sees that murti to be just like the murti that he saw before his eyes; he does not perceive even the slightest difference between the two.
31.7 "Therefore, the same murti that is in Akshardham – which is gunatit – is pratyaksha. There is no difference between the two. Just as the murti in the dham is gunatit, the human murti is also gunatit. The difference which was noticed earlier was due to the gun of the different locations within the body – in the eyes there is sattva-gun; in the throat there is rajo-gun; even the jeev, which resides within the buddhi, is full of gun."
31.8 After delivering this talk, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Please continue singing the kirtan which you were singing earlier."
31.9 In this way, Shreeji Maharaj revealed Himself as Purushottam using the non- pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan as an example.

Committing Sins Under The Excuse Of Bhagvan's Greatness 
32.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Maha sud 5 [8th February 1829], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him. Some of the paramhans were singing kirtans related to the spring season.
32.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked Muktanand Swami and the other sadhus, "Please explain the meaning of the shlok: vishaya vinivartante niraharasya dehinaha : The sense objects recede for a person who refrains from indulging in them. However, the longing for them does not subside. The longing subsides when his vision reaches Bhagvan's.
32.3 The sadhus then explained the shlok according to the commentary written by Ramanuj acharya.
32.4 Shreeji Maharaj then added, "With reference to that shlok, I have formed the belief that a person who is in his youth should reduce his diet and should eat and behave moderately. When a person's diet is reduced, physical strength also diminishes. Only then can the indriyas be overcome; otherwise they cannot. Having done that, if a person enthusiastically engages his mind in the nine types of bhakti of Bhagvan, and himself lovingly engages in bhakti, then he will remain in satsang till the end. But, if he does not behave in this way, he will surely surrender to his indriyas and, sooner or later, he will fall from satsang. Even a person who has mastered samadhi, like Sheth Govardhan, is afraid of this; so what can be said for others?
32.5 "However, a person's diet cannot be controlled by merely observing several upvas consecutively. This only leads to his desires and diet increasing, because when he breaks an upvas, he tends to eat twice as much. However, if a person begins to reduce his diet gradually, it can be controlled. For example, even though the clouds cause rain to fall in tiny drops, water still collects in a large quantity. Similarly, a person should control his diet gradually. As a result, his indriyas will also be controlled. Then, if he lovingly engages in bhakti, he will remain in satsang till the end. This is a fact."
32.6 Shreeji Maharaj then said, "How does a true bhakta of Bhagvan understand Bhagvan's greatness? Well, he believes, 'Bhagvan, who possesses a definite murti, forever resides in His luminous Akshardham. He is the cause and controller of everything, the antaryami within all and the supreme lord of countless millions of brahmands. Moreover, His murti is divine, blissful, and free from the gun of Maya'. Understanding the pratyaksha Bhagvan in this way, he believes that with the exception of Bhagvan, all other worldly objects are absolutely worthless and perishable. In addition, he has love only for Bhagvan, and he engages in the nine types of bhakti. He also believes, 'Kal, Maya, Brahma, Shiv, Surya, and Chandra, are powerful, yet even they act according to the niyams of that extremely great Bhagvan'. Understanding this, he always behaves within the niyams of dharma established by Bhagvan in order to please Him; he never disobeys those niyams.
32.7 "On the other hand, a person who has a corrupted mind believes, 'Such a great Bhagvan is patit-pavan and adham-udharan. So, why worry about slightly disobeying the niyam of dharma? After all, Bhagvan is capable of granting kalyan'. In this way, he does not hesitate in committing sins under the pretext of knowing Bhagvan's greatness. Such a person should be considered wicked and sinful. Also, even though he may superficially appear to be a bhakta, he should not be considered a bhakta, and a person should not remain in his company. Only a person who has the understanding described previously should be considered to be a bhakta, and only his company should be kept."

Gadhada III – 33
All Are Affected By Wealth And Women
33.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Fagan sud 11 [16th March 1829], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in the mandir of Shree Gopinathji in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
33.2 Then, addressing all the paramhans, Shreeji Maharaj said, "In satsang, there are only a few bhaktas whose mind would not be affected by wealth, property, women, and children, and who would not develop faith in those who fulfil the desires related to those things. In fact, there cannot be many bhaktas who are like this." Saying this, Shreeji Maharaj continued, "This Muktanand Swami and Gopalanand Swami are like that, because in no way would they become impressed by anyone, no matter how great he may be, and not even if he were to perform miracles.
33.3 "What are the characteristics of a person who will not be influenced by anyone? Well, such a person believes, 'I am the atma, which is distinct from the body; I am luminous and eternal. Moreover, the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan constantly resides within my own self. Except for the svarup of Bhagvan, all worldly svarups are asatya and full of countless flaws'. A person who has such vairagya and who thoroughly understands the greatness of Bhagvan will never have any kind of doubts in his mind. But having said that, this understanding is very difficult to develop.
33.4 "Even though these two sadhus are so great, if they were to receive a great amount of honour, or if heaps of rupees and gold coins were to be placed before them, or if they were to come across attractive women, then even though they are tyagis, they would not be able to maintain their dharma. In fact, if they do encounter those objects, then it is doubtful whether they would remain equal with even the lowest of our tyagis. This is because that is effect of the association of those objects. For example, see how religious all of us sitting here are. However, if we were to drink bottles of liquor, we would not remain so composed. Similarly, the association of those objects certainly has an effect on a person. Therefore, a person can only be saved from those objects if he does not associate with them. He should be cautious from the beginning, in case he comes across them. Moreover, it is a well-known fact of the shastras that only Bhagvan is unaffected by their association. That is why it has been stated: rushim narayanam-rute... : Of the progeny of Brahma (Marichi), and their progeny (Kashyap), and their progeny (humans and devs) – whose mind in this world, besides that of Narayan Rushi, can be distinguished as being unaffected by the maya and attractive charm of women? ... ye-nye svataha parihrutad-api bibhyati sma : O Master of the indriyas (Bhagvan)! You are indeed the lord of the whole mobile and immobile world, because even though you indulge in the various sense objects created by the imbalance in the gun of Maya, you remain unaffected by them. Apart from you, others still fear the association of the sense objects – even though they have renounced them.
33.5 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Who can be called an ekantik bhakta of Bhagvan? Well, a person who possesses the qualities of svadharma, gnan, vairagya, and unparalleled bhakti towards Bhagvan coupled with knowledge of his greatness, can be called an ekantik bhakta.
33.6 "Furthermore, regarding the ultimate fate of an ekantik bhakta, it is said the he 'enters' Bhagvan. But what is meant by 'entering'? Well, that bhakta has love for the divya murti of Bhagvan, who dwells within a mass of divine light. Due to that love, he has constant awareness of the murti of Bhagvan in his mind, and he behaves as if he is infatuated by that murti. Remaining in that state, he also engages in the service of Bhagvan outwardly. For example, even though Lakshmiji remains in the heart of Bhagvan symbolically and through her profound love, she also outwardly serves him in the svarup of a female. The 'entering' of an ekantik bhakta into Bhagvan should be understood in a similar way.
33.7 "Even at present, the attachment a bhakta has for the ten types of bhakti as well as the attachment he has for svadharma, vairagya, atma- nishtha, keeping the company of a sant and realising the greatness of Bhagvan is such that he can in no way do without it. Even though opium is extremely bitter, a person who is addicted to it cannot live without it. Or, if a person is addicted to alcohol, then even though his throat burns whenever he drinks alcohol, he cannot live without it. Even if someone were to offer him many rupees he would not accept them, because his addiction is dearer to him. This is because that addiction has become ingrained in his jeev. Similarly, if a person was addicted to the bhakti of Bhagvan and other such activities, then even if he remains under the influence of any type of kusang, he would not be able to live without engaging in bhakti. Moreover, his mind would not be pleased in engaging in any other activities. Such a bhakta of Bhagvan, whose jeev has become engrossed in Bhagvan's bhakti and other such activities, and who is extremely eager to perform only those activities, can also be said to have 'entered' Bhagvan.
33.8 "So, what are the characteristics of such a bhakta of Bhagvan? Well, except for the seva of Bhagvan, if he does not wish for even the four types of mukti, how can he desire anything else? Such a person should be known as an ekantik bhakta because he has no desire for anything. A person who is not like this sometimes enjoys engaging in the bhakti of Bhagvan's; but if he encounters evil company, he will forget bhakti and begin to behave immorally. Such a person should be known to be a fake bhakta and a person who believes himself to be the body. He is not a true bhakta and cannot be trusted."
33.9 Then, Shreeji Maharaj continued, "If a bhakta of Bhagvan is vulnerable to women, wealth, svabhavs, and the belief that he is the body, then even if he is engaged in the bhakti of Bhagvan, his bhakti cannot be trusted; he will surely encounter obstacles in it. This is because if at some time he happens to come across women or wealth, then there will be no stability in his bhakti, and he will become engrossed in them. Also, if a person believes himself to be the body, then when he suffers due to some illness, or if he is unable to obtain food and clothing, or if a agna to observe a difficult vartman is given, then again, his bhakti will be disturbed. In fact, he will become frustrated and will not be able to think; he will begin to behave immorally. Also, if he has a certain svabhav, and if a sant lectures him instead of allowing him to behave according to his svabhav, and makes him behave opposite to it, then also he will become disturbed. Then, if he cannot remain in the company of a sant, how will he be able to maintain bhakti? Therefore, a person who wishes to develop firm bhakti should not be vulnerable in these four aspects. If there is a flaw in these four, it should be slowly eradicated with understanding. Only then can a person perform constant bhakti of Bhagvan. What I have just said is absolutely true; there is no doubt in it whatsoever."

Maintaining Desires Only For Bhagvan's - Expressing Anger At Those Who Disobey The Niyams Of Dharma
34.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Chaitra sud 3 [6th April 1829], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in the mandir of Shree Gopinathji in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
34.2 Then, Shuk Muni asked Shreeji Maharaj, "There appear to be two means by which desires for only Bhagvan remain , and desires for any worldly object do not remain. One is love for Bhagvan, and other is vairagya coupled with gnan. These are the two means. For a person who does not practise these two means firmly, but who does have nishchay in Bhagvan and the belief of Bhagvan, is there a third means by which he can maintain desires only for Bhagvan and not for anything else?"
34.3 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said in reply, "That is a good question because it is true that only by those two means do desires only for Bhagvan remain , and desires for any worldly object do not remain. If a person does not practice those two means, then his desires for objects other than Bhagvan will not be eradicated. As a result, he remains unhappy in life. But, since he has nishchay in Bhagvan, he will be granted kalyan by Bhagvan after death.
34.4 "However, just like those two means, there is also a third means for eradicating desires for objects other than Bhagvan. What is it? Well, it is to vigilantly observe the prescribed niyams. What are those niyams? Some are svadharma niyams, that are related to the duties of a person's varna and ashram. Just as there are niyams for an atma-nivedi sadhu and a brahm-chari, similarly, even though a person is not an atma-nivedi, he should still follow the niyams of not seeing women and not listening to talks about them. In this way, he should strictly and attentively observe the niyams related to abandoning the panch-vishays. Also, he should physically serve Bhagvan and His bhaktas, and he should listen to kathas related to Bhagvan. In this way, if he observes niyams in the form of engaging in the nine types of bhakti, then his mind will also begin to think about good thoughts. So, if a person behaves according to these two niyams, then as a result, even if he does not have vairagya or love for Bhagvan, they will develop; he will become extremely powerful; impure desires for objects will be eradicated; and only desires for Bhagvan will flourish day by day."
34.5 Again, Shuk Muni asked, "Maharaj, it seems krodh arises when a person's desire for a certain object or his sense of 'my-ness' for something is violated by someone. When a desire, such as a craving, is not satisfied, then that desire results in krodh. So, it can be said that such a person has developed a svabhav in which krodh can arise. Is it possible that krodh will not arise even in such situations?"
34.6 Shreeji Maharaj replied, "A great sant, due to Bhagvan's agna or by his own wish after understanding Bhagvan's greatness according to the shastras, may have made a firm decision to keep countless people within the niyams of dharma, and to lead them onto the path of Bhagvan. This sant may express anger on a person who disobeys the niyam of dharma and follows adharma. If the sant does not express anger and does not lecture that person in order to teach him to remain within the niyams of dharma, then that person will continue to disobey those niyams and will not progress. Therefore, anger expressed for this reason is beneficial; there is nothing unsuitable about it. This is because thousands of people have taken refuge of the great sant who has chosen to take this path. So, how can they possibly not be slightly lectured?
34.7 "However, anger will not arise if a person avoids the very cause of that anger. Obviously, anger will not arise, if a person is travelling alone in the jungle; but how can a great sant do that? After all, he has understood from the shastras the great rewards involved in guiding countless people towards Bhagvan by talks, in order that they attain kalyan. Similarly, he has also understood the importance of observing Bhagvan's agna. Therefore, even though he may express anger, he still does not abandon his decision to lead people to kalyan.
34.8 A person who has developed attachment with a great sant, has understood that his personal interest of attaining kalyan can be fulfilled by the sant. Also, he believes, 'I can only attain kalyan through this sant'. Then, even though he may have the svabhav of krodh, he will never express that krodh on that great sant. In fact, he will surely abandon his svabhav. So, krodh can also be eradicated in this way.
34.9 "On the other hand, a person who becomes angry on a sant over the exchange of some worthless objects has simply not understood the greatness of the sant, or the true path of a sant. If he had understood it, then he would not become angry over such worthless objects. Even if such a person is intelligent and understanding, if he does become angry on a sant for worthless objects, then his intellect should be considered to be like that of a king's minister – skilled only in worldly affairs. He does not possess the intellect of sant."

Gadhada III – 35
Forcefully Altering Svabhav - Bhagvan Is Insulted When His Bhakta Is Insulted
35.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Chaitra sud 9 [12th April 1829], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in the mandir of Shree Gopinathji in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of sadhus, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
35.2 Then, Shuk Muni asked, "Maharaj, how can we recognise that a person has such a firm refuge of Bhagvan and His bhaktas that it will not falter in any way – regardless of the extent of suffering he may have to face; regardless of any physical happiness or distress; and regardless of whether he faces honour or insult, or even unpleasant circumstances? Please also describe what type of thoughts such a person has in mind, as well as how he behaves physically?"
35.3 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said in reply, "If a bhakta realises that only Bhagvan is great, but he does not believe anything else to be greater than Bhagvan; and if he also believes that everything except Bhagvan is worthless; and if he does not become disturbed or annoyed when Bhagvan or His sant attempts to forcefully alter his svabhav or when they do not allow him to behave according to his svabhav; and if he can abandon his svabhav, no matter how embedded it may be, and follow the agna of Bhagvan and His sant in a simple way – then that bhakta's acceptance of the refuge of Bhagvan will not falter, regardless of how difficult the circumstances may be."
35.4 Shuk Muni then queried, "Such a person must become disturbed, because when someone's svabhav is forcefully altered, he naturally becomes disturbed. So, are there differences in the types of disturbances that are experienced or not?"
35.5 Shreeji Maharaj explained, "If a person is disturbed when his nature is forcefully altered, and if he then finds avgun within himself rather than with Bhagvan or His sant, then he is good. However, instead of finding faults with himself, if a person perceives avgun in Bhagvan and His sant, then his future is uncertain, and there is no stability in his refuge of Bhagvan. "
35.6 Again, Shuk Muni asked, "If Bhagvan or His sant have never attempted to twist a person's nature, how can he realise in his own mind, 'If they do attempt to do so at some time in the future, I will become disturbed'. After all, how can a person be sure of something that he has not experienced?"
35.7 Hearing this, Shreeji Maharaj explained, "A person should think about the thoughts that occur in his mind. For example, 'In the mind, besides the thoughts of Bhagvan, there are also thoughts related to the panch-vishays. Of these, for which objects do I have powerful desires and for which do I have strong cravings?' If a person thinks in this way, he can realise himself as he truly is; otherwise, he cannot. During the thinking of those thoughts, he should also realise, 'I have very strong desires for this object, and I am striving to attain it. However, when a sant attempts to have me abandon it, I will become disturbed'. In this way, he becomes clear about his own self. If his svabhav is stubborn, and Bhagvan or His sant do not attempt to alter it, then he will survive in satsang. However, if they do attempt to alter it, then he will definitely fall. Ultimately, he will become extremely disturbed and will fall from satsang."
35.8 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "The shastras claim that to insult a sant is the greatest of all sins. What is the reason for this? Well, it is because Shree Krishna Bhagvan Himself resides in the heart of that sant. Therefore, when a person insults a sant, he insults Bhagvan as well. After all, when a person insults a sant, Bhagvan, who resides within his heart, is hurt. In such a case, the sin of insulting Bhagvan is an even greater sin. Therefore, it is said that to insult the sant is the greatest of all sins.
35.9 "Having said that though, Kans, Shishupal, Putna, and other demons insulted Bhagvan, yet Bhagvan still granted them kalyan like that of a bhakta. This is because even though it was out of hatred, those demons did think about Bhagvan. So, Bhagvan felt, 'Those demons thought of me, and therefore associated with me, even though it was out of hatred. So, I should grant them kalyan'. These cases should be taken as examples of Bhagvan's compassion. A person should also realise, 'If Bhagvan granted them kalyan even though they sought the refuge of Bhagvan through hatred, why would Bhagvan not grant kalyan to a bhakta who seeks His refuge by offering bhakti and who pleases Him by that bhakti? Of course, He will'.
35.10 "The intention of those who have written the shastras is to inspire people towards the bhakti of Bhagvan by showing Bhagvan's great compassion; their intention was not to allow people to behave against Bhagvan's wishes like the demons. Therefore, a person who spites Bhagvan by keeping hatred towards Him and who behaves against His wishes should definitely be considered to be a demon – because that is the way of demons. However, a person should behave only in a way that will please Bhagvan; he should engage in bhakti and please Him and His bhaktas. That is the way of the bhaktas of Bhagvan. "
35.11 Shuk Muni then asked further, "Maharaj, what are the characteristics of a sant who is such that by insulting him, Bhagvan residing within his heart is also insulted, and by performing his seva, Bhagvan's seva is also performed?"
35.12 Shreeji Maharaj thought for a while and then answered out of compassion: "First of all, the most important characteristic is that he never believes Bhagvan to be nirakar. He understands Bhagvan to eternally sakar. No matter how many of the Purans, Upanishads, Veds, or other shastras he may hear – if ever he comes across the idea of Bhagvan being nirakar, he thinks, 'Either I have not understood the true meaning of the shastras, or there may be other purpose behind such words; but Bhagvan is always sakar'. If he does not understand Bhagvan be sakar, then his upasana cannot be considered to be firm. Also, if Bhagvan is nirakar, then He could not be called the all-doer – just as akash cannot be called the doer; and nor could He be said to reside in one location. Therefore, Bhagvan is eternally sakar. In addition, He is the creator, sustainer, and destroyer of countless brahmands; He is forever present in His Akshardham; He is the lord of all; and He is pratyaksha here before your eyes. The sant mentioned above always has this understanding; but this understanding of his is never shaken in any way or under any circumstances.
35.13 "Secondly, he engages himself in the ekantik bhakti of Bhagvan. Moreover, when he sees someone else engaged in kathas, singing kirtans, and chanting the holy name of Bhagvan, he becomes extremely pleased in his mind.
35.14 "Thirdly, when he stays amongst bhaktas, he does not allow any of his svabhavs to interfere. In fact, he will abandon his svabhavs, but he will not leave the company of the bhaktas of Bhagvan. If a sant happens to criticise his svabhavs, he does not have hatred towards the sant. Instead, he finds faults with his own svabhavs, but he never becomes upset or even thinks of departing from the company of the bhaktas of Bhagvan. In this way, he remains within the company of bhaktas.
35.15 "Fourthly, when he comes across any precious item, such as an expensive piece of clothing, some delicious food, or clean water, 'It would be nice to give this to a bhakta of Bhagvan'. He would give away the items to him and be happy.
35.16 "Fifth, the bhaktas in whose company he is staying do not feel, 'He has beeen staying with us for so many years, yet we have not been able to truly understand him; and who knows what he is really like? It is difficult to judge him'. He would not be like that. Instead, he would be such that everyone would know him outwardly and inwardly, and they would feel, 'He is definitely like this'. He would be of such an honest nature.
35.17 "Sixth, even if he is of a quiet nature, he would not like the company of kusangis; and if he does happen to come across them, he would become angry. In this way, he has a natural dislike for the company of those who are vimukhs.
35.18 "Therefore, it should be known that Bhagvan Himself resides in the heart of a sant who possesses these six qualities. By insulting such a sant, a person commits a sin equivalent to insulting Bhagvan; and if he performs seva of such a sant, he earns rewards equivalent to performing seva of Bhagvan. "

The Most Extraordinary Spiritual Activity For Kalyan - The Company Of A Shushka-Vedanti
36.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Vaishakh sud 1 [4th May 1829], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj rode on horseback from Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada and arrived at Lakshmi-Vadi. He sat on a platform within the grounds. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places had gathered before Him.
36.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj asked all the paramhans and bhaktas, "What is the most extraordinary spiritual activity for the kalyan of the jeev, which will surely guarantee kalyan and prevent all other obstacles from hindering that kalyan? Also, what is the great obstacle in that activity for kalyan, on account of which a person would certainly fall from the path of kalyan? Please answer both of these questions."
36.3 Everyone answered according to their understanding, but the question was not answered satisfactorily.
36.4 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said in reply, "The most extraordinary spiritual activity is to understand Purushottam Bhagvan, who is seated amidst the mass of light of Brahm, as eternally having a svarup. Furthermore, after understanding that all avatars originate from Him, a person should accept the refuge of the pratyaksha svarup of Bhagvan by any means possible. He should also offer bhakti to that Bhagvan while observing dharma, as well as associate with a sant possessing such bhakti. That is the most extraordinary spiritual activity for kalyan. A person encounters no obstacles along that path.
36.5 "A major obstacle in practising that spiritual activity is keeping the company of shushka-vedantis. Which obstacles arise when a person keeps their company? Initially, he develops affection for them. That affection develops due to the kindness of the vedantis. For example, if a person has saved someone's life by giving him some food during a famine, then that person would naturally develop affection for him. In this way, a person develops affection for a person who has helped him. Also, those shushka-vedantis would point out advantages, such as, 'The atma does not undergo births and deaths, and it is formless. In fact, regardless of the number of sins a person may commit, the atma remains immune to those flaws'. Pointing out such advantages, they criticise the svarup of Bhagvan. That is a major obstacle since it leads to the rejection of Bhagvan's svarup. Therefore, a person should never keep the company of shushka-vedantis – they are absolutely ignorant. In fact, there is no greater obstacle on the path of bhakti than this."
36.6 Then, Shreeji Maharaj returned to Dada Khachar's darbar. There, He sat on a large decorated bedstead on the veranda outside the east- facing rooms and said, "I have heard all the shastras and have formed a principle. I have also travelled throughout this land and seen many yogis." Shreeji Maharaj then narrated the stories of Gopaldasji and other sadhus. He then continued by saying, "I believe that it is impossible to see the atma and brahm without the upasana and dhyan of Bhagvan's murti. Only through upasana can the atma and brahm be seen; without it, they cannot be seen. In fact, wishing to see the atma and brahm without upasana is like attempting to lick the sky with the tongue; even if a person tries for a hundred years, he will never be able to taste it as sour or salty. Similarly, the atma and brahm simply cannot be seen without the upasana of the murti of Bhagvan – regardless of the efforts a person may resort to. Furthermore, the fact that the shastras mention the possibility of atma- nishtha through nirbij Sankhya and Yog is irrelevant – I have not seen anyone do so, nor is the claim in agreement with my experience. Therefore, the claim is false."

Gadhada III – 37
The Happiness Of Bhagvan Is Never Forgotten 
37.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Vaishakh sud 3 [6th May 1829], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a square cushion on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
37.2 Then, addressing all the sadhus and bhaktas, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Once a person has thoroughly attained the gnan of Bhagvan, then even if the factors of desh, kal, kriya, and sang become unpleasant for him, his gnan does not diminish in the least. For example, take the analogy of a great king or a millionaire. If he happens to lose his status due to his prarabdha and becomes poor, and because of that if he has only cheap food to eat, such as low-quality grains, or spinach, or moss, or berries, or boiled pipal fruit, then he would certainly eat it; but he would also recall the expensive foods that he formerly obtained and ate. In his mind he would think, 'I used to eat all those delicious foods in the past, whereas now I eat such common food'. In this way, whenever he eats, he would recall this. However, if a person has been eating such common food from the beginning, and if he becomes even poorer, then he continues to eat the same type of food as before. So, what does he have to recall? Nothing.
37.3 "So, once a person has thoroughly known the bliss of Bhagvan and the bliss of worshipping Bhagvan in his own mind, then even if he can no longer remain within satsang and has to leave, he will experience happiness and misery according to his prarabdha while remembering that bliss; he will not forget it. But, what is there to recall for someone who has not known that bliss of Bhagvan and who has not experienced it? Nothing. Such a person is like an animal."
37.4 Continuing, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Now, I shall narrate to you the gnan of the murti of Bhagvan. No dev, human or anything created from Prakruti, possesses a murti like Bhagvan. In addition, Kal devours everything except Bhagvan; Kal's powers are incapable of affecting Bhagvan. This is what Bhagvan is like. In fact, only Bhagvan is like Bhagvan; no one else can even compare to Him. Also, a bhakta in the dham of Bhagvan who has attained characteristics similar to Bhagvan also possesses a svarup similar to that of Bhagvan. Nevertheless, that bhakta is still a mukta, and Bhagvan is Purushottam. Bhagvan is supreme amongst everyone and is worthy to be worshipped by everyone. He is also their master. However, no one can understand the greatness of that Bhagvan. He has a divya murti, is nirgun, and is worthy of performing dhyan upon. In fact, that murti of Bhagvan is such that a person who performs dhyan upon Him becomes nirgun himself.
37.5 "Moreover, while staying in one place, in His dham, Bhagvan resides by way of His anvay form as the antaryami and the giver of the deserved rewards of karmas to all the jeev s in countless brahmands. He is the very life of all jeev s; and without Him, those jeev s are not capable of doing anything or indulging in anything.
37.6 "In addition, that Bhagvan is the master of all yogic powers. Just as a person who has attained yogic powers can obtain any object with his own hands, even in Brahm-Lok, while sitting here, similarly, Bhagvan performs all activities while staying in one place only using His yogic powers. Also, for example, the fire that is latent within wood and stone is different from the wood and stone themselves. Similarly, Bhagvan dwells within all jeev s, but His svarup is different from the svarup of the jeevs.
37.7 "That Bhagvan Himself, possessing countless divya powers, becomes like a human for the purpose of granting kalyan to the jeev s. If a person develops the gnan of that svarup of Bhagvan in this way, then if he has offered bhakti to that Bhagvan and has fully experienced the bliss of that gnan and bhakti as it really is at least once in his jeev, he will never forget it. In fact, regardless of whatever happiness or distress comes his way, he does not forget the experience of that bliss of Bhagvan's svarup, just as the king in a state of poverty does not forget the happiness of his past.
37.8 "I tell you this because currently all of you are present in satsang; but, due to unpleasant circumstances or unpleasant prarabdha, if a person no longer remains in satsang, then if he has understood this fact, his jeev can still attain kalyan. Also, if a person has such a belief, he will never feel, 'I will not attain kalyan'. After all, to continuously remain in satsang is indeed extremely difficult. In fact, to physically behave as described is also rare. However, if a person someday happens to leave satsang, then even if he cannot physically behave like this at that time, his jeev will still benefit greatly if he has understood this fact. That is why I have delivered this talk."

Gadhada III – 38
Avoiding The Six Desires
38.1 In the Samvat year 1885, on Vaishakh sud 14 [17th May 1829], Swami Shree Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in the mandir of Shree Gopinathji in Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
38.2 Then, Shreeji Maharaj said, "Having thought about the Sankhya shastras as well as other shastras, I have formed the belief that all svarups that are the result of the entities evolved from Maya are false. This is because all of those svarups will be destroyed by Kal. On the other hand, the svarup of Bhagvan in Akshardham and the svarup of the muktas – the parshads of Bhagvan – are all satya, divya, and extremely luminous. Also, the svarup of that Bhagvan and those muktas is two-armed like that of a human being, and it is sachidanand. That Bhagvan, residing in Akshardham, is served by those muktas with various types of divya items, and He is always present there to bestow supreme bliss upon the muktas.
38.3 "It is that same supreme Purushottam Bhagvan who takes birth on this earth out of compassion – for the purpose of granting kalyan to the jeev s. He is presently visible before everyone; He is your ishtadev; and He accepts your seva. In fact, there is absolutely no difference between the pratyaksha svarup of Purushottam Bhagvan visible before you and the svarup of Bhagvan residing in Akshardham; both are one. Also, this pratyaksha svarup of Purushottam Bhagvan is the controller of all, including Akshar. He is the lord ( sarvopari) of all the ishvars and the cause of all the avatars ( avatari). Moreover, He is worthy of being worshipped by all of you. The many previous avatars of this Bhagvan are worthy of being bowed down to and worthy of respect."
38.4 Shreeji Maharaj then explained, "A person who possesses the following six characteristics will never become happy, either in this life or even after death: greed for wealth and other things; desires to associate with women; attachment of the tongue to various tastes; the belief that a person is the body; affection for kusangis; and attachment to relatives. Therefore, a person who desires to be happy should eradicate these svabhavs, maintain nivrutti, and not keep the company of those equal himself. A person should also attach his jeev to the bhaktas of Bhagvan – the great sant – who does not identify his self with the body, who possesses vairagya, and who feels that he has disobeyed a major agna of Bhagvan even if he has disobeyed a minor agna. A person should act according to his agna by thought, word, and deed. Also, he should certainly avoid the vishays, and in no way should he allow them to come near by abandoning his niyams. If a person does begin to associate with the vishays, he will certainly fall. This should be accepted as a universal principle."

Gadhada III – 39
Vishalya-Karani Herbal Medicine - There Is Only One Bhagvan
39.1 In the Samvat year 1886, on Ashadh vad 10 [25th July 1829], Shreeji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar's darbar in Gadhada. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabha of paramhans, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.
39.2 Addressing all the paramhans and satsangis, Shreeji Maharaj said, "What is Bhagvan's maya? Well, maya is nothing but the sense of 'Iness' towards the body and 'my-ness' towards anything related to the body. These should be eradicated. Anyone who eradicates maya can be said to have gone beyond maya. In fact, it is the principle of all the shastras that a person should eradicate maya and develop love for Bhagvan. This principle must be understood – either today or at some time in the future. Great bhaktas, such as Hanuman, Narad, and Prahlad, have also asked from Bhagvan, 'Protect us from maya in the form of 'I-ness' and 'my-ness', and may we develop love for you. May we also have the company of a sant who has gone beyond maya and has love for you; and may we develop affection and a sense of 'my-ness' towards him as well'. Therefore, we too should do the same and ask for the same, as well as do shravan, manan, and nididhyas on this principle."
39.3 Then continuing, Shreeji Maharaj said, "A bhakta of Bhagvan requires the strength of two things: atma-nishtha and the greatness of Bhagvan. What is atma-nishtha? It is to realise the atma as being distinct from the body. If while staying among the sadhus there happens to be a quarrel from some reason, or if the feelings of 'I-ness' and 'my-ness', or vicious natures such as man, krodh, svad, lobh, kam, matsar, and irshya, prevail, then a person who does not regard himself as the atma perceives avgun in the sadhus. This would be extremely harmful for him. That is why a person should realise his true self as being the atma, distinct from the body.
39.4 "That atma is neither a brahman, nor a kshatriya, nor a kanbi. It is no one's son and no one's father. It belongs to no varna. It is radiant like the sun and fire; but it is also full of chaitanya. The flames of fire and the rays of the sun are jad because they do not move when touched by a finger. However, when an ant is touched by a finger, it moves and turns back. This implies that the atma is full of consciousness. It is said to be similar to the sun or to fire, but that is merely because its form is similar in radiance.
39.5 "The atma has passed through countless life forms. In fact, it is said that a person has drank as much milk from his mothers as there is water in the ocean. In those lives, the atma has experienced death in countless ways, yet it has not perished. It has remained as it is. So, if it did not perish in that state of ignorance when it regarded itself as the body, how shall it perish now that we have its gnan? Therefore, we should realise that atma as our true self.
39.6 "Furthermore, how should the greatness of Bhagvan be understood? Well, Bhagvan is the lord of the lords of countless brahmands. However, the brahmands of which He is the lord are insignificant compared to Him. Therefore, it is said: dyupataya eva ten a yayur-antam anantataya tvamapi yad-antaranda-nichaya nanu savaranaha : Even the masters of the higher loks cannot understand your greatness, because it is endless. Neither can you yourself understand your own greatness. In your each and every hair, countless brahmands and their barriers (jad prakruti) fly simultaneously at immense speed – like specks of dust flying in the air. Even the Shrutis, ultimately perish in you, and fail to praise your glory.
39.7 "Within each brahmand there are Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiv, as well as the pruthvi with its seven dvips, seven oceans, Meru, and Loka-Lok, and other mountains. The brahmands also contain the fourteen loks, the eight barriers, and many other things. Bhagvan is the lord of countless such brahmands. For example, person can realise the reputation of an emperor of the world, even though his villages can be counted. But, the reputation of Bhagvan is much greater because even those countless brahmands are insignificant to Him. So then, of what significance can the beings of those brahmands be before Bhagvan's? They are of no significance at all; they are utterly insignificant.
39.8 "Furthermore, in those brahmands, what are the pleasures of the panch-vishays that Bhagvan has given to the jeev s like? Well, those pleasures seem extremely rare; so much so, that many have given their heads for them. However, the bliss of Bhagvan's own murti and of His dham are indeed outstanding. The pleasures of the worldly vishays are dependent on other factors and must be experienced distinctly. In comparison, Bhagvan is the reservoir of all forms of bliss. Moreover, the bliss of Bhagvan is imperishable and extremely alokik. For this, consider the following analogy: An extremely wealthy man enjoys a great variety of food at home. Then, after finishing the meal, he throws a leftover piece of rotlo to a dog. In this case, the leftover piece of rotlo can be considered utterly inferior, and the various delicious foods that the wealthy man enjoys can be considered to be full of pleasure. In the same way, Bhagvan has given the countless jeev s of the brahmands the pleasures of the panch-vishays; but they are inferior like the piece of rotlo thrown to the dog, whereas the bliss of Bhagvan Himself is far greater.
39.9 "Even so, Bhagvan grants a great deal of happiness to the jeev during the state of sushupti. During sushupti, a person is relieved of even severe pain, and instead, he experiences profound peace.
39.10 "Even the great bhaktas such as Brahma, Shiv, Lakshmiji, Radhaji, Narad, Shukji, the Sanakadik, and the nine Yogeshvars apply the dust of Bhagvan's holy feet upon their heads. They put aside all their self-importance and constantly offer bhakti to Him.
39.11 "Moreover, just look at the diverse creation created by Bhagvan! What creativity He has used! Just see, a human is born of a human, and an animal from an animal; a tree from a tree, and an ant from an ant. Also, no matter how intelligent someone may be, no one is capable of replacing a destroyed part of someone's body exactly as it was before. Bhagvan possesses innumerable such skills. Therefore, by realising the greatness of Bhagvan and realising Him to be blissful, a person develops vairagya for all things, and develops love for Bhagvan alone.
39.12 "If a person attains the gnan of his jeevatma and the gnan of Bhagvan's greatness as mentioned earlier, then even if he has somehow become attached to any sort of pleasures of the panch-vishays, he would not remain bound by them, but would break that bondage and withdraw from them. Then, how can a person who abandons the pleasures of the panch-vishays become attached? Therefore, having listened to these two types of gnan, a person should apply them within his mind with great enthusiasm. For example, a brave and fierce man would be extremely angered if an enemy killed his father. If the enemy harassed him further by killing his son and brother, kidnapping his wife, passing on his mother to a Muslim, as well as stealing all his belongings, the man would become increasingly angered as he is harassed more and more. At all times then – while awake as well as in his dreams – he would be obsessed by only this. In the same way, only when a person is constantly obsessed by these two topics can that gnan be realised. Then, that gnan would assist him against any sort of difficulty that may occur. For example, when Hanumanji brought the vishalya-karani herbal medicine for Ramchandraji and gave it to Him to drink, all the arrows from Ramchandraji's body fell out by themselves. Similarly, all the 'arrows' in the form of the desires of the indriyas to indulge in the vishays are removed when these two points have been embedded in a person's mind. The vruttis of his indriyas withdraw from the pleasures of the vishays and become rooted only in Bhagvan. Only he is a satsangi, because only he who associates with his own satya atma and satya Bhagvan can be called a satsangi.
39.13 "If a religious person were to hear the talks of these two points, they would stir his heart and pervade every pore of his body. Conversely, if a demonic person were to hear them, they would not touch his heart at all; instead, they would exit from his ears, just as khir would not remain in a dog's stomach because the dog would vomit it out. In actual fact, nothing can be said to be as delicious as khir, yet it does not remain in a dog's stomach, let alone pervade its body. On the other hand, if a man were to eat khir, it would indeed pervade every pore of his body, and it would be extremely enjoyable. Likewise, these talks do not enter into the hearts of dog-like, demonic people; these talks enter and pervade totally only in the hearts of religious people."
39.14 Shreeji Maharaj then added, "Only Bhagvan is like Bhagvan. Many have attained qualities similar to His by worshipping Him, yet they certainly do not become like Bhagvan. If they did become like Bhagvan, this would suggest the existence of several Bhagvans. As a result, the control of the world would not remain organised. One Bhagvan would say, 'I will create the world', while another Bhagvan would say, 'I will destroy the world'. One Bhagvan would say, 'I will make it rain', while another would say, 'I will not'. One Bhagvan would say, 'I will instil human instincts in animals', while another would say, 'I will instil animal instincts in humans'. A stable state would not be possible in this situation. But, see how organised everything functions in the world! There is not even the slightest irregularity. Therefore, the ruler of all activities and the lord of all is one Bhagvan. Not only that, it seems that no one can ever challenge Him. Therefore, Bhagvan is definitely one, and no one can become like Him.
39.15 "All these facts that I have revealed may be simple, but they include everything. However, only the wise can grasp their essence, but not others. Whoever understands these facts and thoroughly strengthens them has accomplished everything; he has nothing more to achieve. Having listened to these talks delivered by me, a person should keep the company of those bhaktas of Bhagvan who have thoroughly absorbed them. This will lead to the day-by-day strengthening of those talks."
39.16 In conclusion, Shreeji Maharaj revealed, "I deliver these talks to you not from any imagination of my mind, nor to display any sort of skill. I have experienced all that I have spoken about. In fact, I speak in accordance to what I practise. Outwardly, I may have a great deal of contact with women, wealth, and the panch-vishays. In fact, wherever I go – Surat, Amdavad, Vadodara, Vadtal – thousands of people gather; they obey me, honour me, and welcome me with great festivity; and I stay in luxurious places and receive rich clothes and vehicles. Despites all this, whenever I look towards my atma and towards the greatness of Bhagvan, it all seems absolutely worthless. I cannot become attached to any of it, and I become unaware of it all, just as a person is unaware of his past lives. The reason I can behave in such way is that I have thoroughly realised the two topics mentioned before. In fact, whoever realises them would also behave accordingly if ever he were somehow put in similar circumstances. Therefore, these two topics should be understood by all means."
39.17 In this way, Shreeji Maharaj, out of great compassion, addressed others on the basis of His own behaviour. However, He is Shree Purushottam Narayan.


Bhugol Khagol - Geography And Astronomy
1 From Bhadarva sud 1 to Bhadarva sud 11, Samvat 1863 [11 to 21 November 1806], Shreeji Maharaj sat under the harmo tree in Bhakti-Bag, in Gadhada, and dictated a letter to Shuk Muni addressed to His bhaktas. The letter included a description of pruthvi, the dvips and the khands; the time span of the yugs; and a narration of the various types of destruction in reference to the rarity of attaining a human birth in Bharat-Khand. It incorporated the message of being determined to attain kalyan rather than engaging too deeply in worldly activities. A similar letter is also noted in the Shree Hari Leelamrut.
2 "The Shreemad Bhagvat and other sacred shastras state that it is extremely rare to receive a human birth in Bharat-Khand, and that it can be equalled to receiving a chintamani. In fact, even Indra and other devs long for a human birth. The vishays, the riches, and luxuries, as well as the lifespan of the devs greatly exceed that of humans, yet they have no means of attaining moksh in their own loks. Only after receiving a human birth in Bharat-Khand can a jeev attain moksh. In no other place and with no other body is kalyan possible. For this reason, attaining a human birth in Bharat-Khand is better than being born in any of the other region of Mrutyu-Lok. Therefore, there is no place in the fourteen loks that can compare with Bharat-Khand.
3 "Here are the names of those fourteen loks, of which six are above Mrutyu-Lok: Firstly, there is Bhuvar-Lok, where impure devs reside. Second is Svarg-Lok, where Indra and other devs reside. Third is Mahar-Lok, where Aryam and other ancestral devs reside. Fourth is Jan-Lok and, fifth is Tap-Lok. Bhrugu and other rushis stay in these two loks. Finally, the sixth and highest lok is Satya-Lok, where Brahma resides. These are the seven loks including Mrutyu-Lok.
4 "Below Mrutyulok there are a further seven loks. In Atal, Vital, and Sutal, the demons reside. Below them are Talatal, Mahatal, and Rasatal, in which nocturnal beings reside. Finally, Patal is the seventh lok, where serpents reside. These seven loks are below Mrutyu-Lok. This makes fourteen loks in total, of which Mrutyu-Lok is the best.
5 "Mrutyu-Lok comprises of seven spherical dvips: "In the centre is Jambu-Dvip, which is 100,000 yojans in size. It is surrounded by an ocean of salt-water that is also 100,000 yojans in size. "The second dvip is Plaksh-Dvip, which is 200,000 yojans in size. It is surrounded by an ocean of ikshu (sugarcane juice), which is also 200,000 yojans in size." The third dvip is Shalmali-Dvip, which is circular, and is 400,000 yojans in size. It is surrounded by an ocean of sura (alcohol), which is also 400,000 yojans in size. "The fourth dvip is Kush-Dvip, which is also circular, and is 800,000 yojans wide. It is surrounded by an ocean of ghrut ( ghee), which is also 800,000 yojans in size. "The fifth dvip is Kraunch-Dvip, which is 1,600,000 yojans in size. It is surrounded by an ocean of kshir (milk), which is also 1,600,000 yojans in size. "The sixth dvip is Shak-Dvip, which is 3,200,000 yojans wide. It is surrounded by an ocean of dadhi-mandod (yoghurt), which is also 3,200,000 yojans in size. "Finally, the seventh dvip is called Pushkar-Dvip, which is 6,400,000 yojans in size. It is surrounded by an ocean of sweet sudha ( amrut), which is also 6,400,000 yojans in size. "These are the seven dvips that make up Mrutyu-Lok, of which Jambu-Dvip is the best.
6 "Jambu-Dvip itself comprises of nine khands. At the centre is the golden Mount Meru. Surrounding its base on all four sides is the landmass called Ilavart-Khand, where Sankarshan is worshipped, and Shivji is the main bhakta. To the west of Meru is Ketumal-Khand, which is also called Subhag. There, Pradyumna is worshipped, and Lakshmiji is the main bhakta. "To the north of Meru, there are three khands: Ramyak-Khand – where Matsya is worshipped, and Savarni Manu is the main bhakta; north of that is Hiranyamay-Khand – where Kurma is worshipped, and Aryama is the main bhakta; and north of that still is Kuru-Khand-where Varah is worshipped, and Pruthvi is the main bhakta. This makes five khands. "To the east of Meru there is the khand called Bhadrashva-Khand – where Hayagriv is worshipped, and Bhadrashrava is the main bhakta. South of Meru, there are a further three khands: Harivarsh-Khand – where Nrusinh is worshipped, and Prahlad is the main bhakta; south of that is Kimpurush-Khand – where Ram is worshipped, and Hanuman is the main bhakta; and further south of that is Bharat-Khand – where Nar-Narayan is worshipped, and Naradji is the main bhakta. These are the nine khands of Jambu-Dvip. Of these, Bharat-Khand is the best because although the other eight have a greater extent of worldly pleasures to indulge in, a person cannot attain kalyan there – activities for kalyan are only possible in Bharat-Khand. For this reason, there is no place in the fourteen loks equal to Bharat-Khand.
7 "Within Bharat-Khand, there are thirteen regions which are anarya (immoral). They are: [1] Bangal, [2] Nepal, [3] Bhut, [4] Kamakshi, [5] Sindh, [6] Kabul, [7] Lahor, [8] Multan, [9] Iran, [10] Astambol, [11] Arbastan, [12] Sval, and [13] Pilpilam. These thirteen are impure. It is very difficult for someone who has taken birth there to attain the association of a sadguru (the granter of moksh) and to understand the nature of moksh.
8 "Twelve-and-a-half regions in Bharat-Khand are said to be arya (sacred). These are: [1] Purva, [2] Vraj, [3] Malav, [4] Maru, [5] Panjab, [6] Gujarat, [7] Dakshin, [8] Malbar, [9] Tilang, [10] Dravid, [11] Barmalar, [12] Sorath, and half of Kutch. These twelve-and-a-half regions are superior. There, the sadguru –who is a knower of brahm – is always present. Whoever receives a human birth in these regions is able to understand dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti, and is able to realise the path to kalyan. How does he come to realise this? Well, these regions are called the best because of the many avatars of Bhagvan that take birth there. Therefore, all humans of Bharat-Khand can attain kalyan if they make an effort; if they do not make an effort, they will not attain kalyan. Therefore, a person who is wise should abandon violence and other such vicious natures, abandon evil influences, and seek the refuge of the sadguru, who is a knower of brahm, and perform his seva.
9 "The sadguru, whose characteristics are noted in the sacred shastras, is someone who is gifted with the noble gun of dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti. After recognising that sadguru, a person should seek his refuge, keep his body, indriyas, and antah-karans in accordance with his agna, and engage in the worship of Bhagvan. This is the only means for attaining kalyan. Whoever has done this in the past, is presently doing so, or will do so in the future, should be regarded as a person who has best made use of his durlabh human body, as a person who has true understanding, and as a person who is renowned. Conversely, a person who does not understand this, wastes such a durlabh human birth by craving the insignificant pleasures of the world, and by having faith in the words of a hypocritical, misleading guru – who himself is prey to death. Even though this person may be called understanding, renowned, wise among the bhaktas, and highly respected, his respect and fame are merely like a dream. Those who assume such fame and respect to be true and are obsessed by them, but do not understand the path to kalyan, are called fools and self-destroyers by a sant and by the sacred shastras. They would then have to wait a great deal of time before receiving another human birth in such a place where kalyan can be attained.
10 "The duration of this time is stated in the shastras. One lav of Brahma is equal to 666 human years and eight months. Sixty lav equal one nimish, which is equivalent to 40,000 human years. Sixty nimish equals one pal, which is the equivalent of 2,400,000 human years. Sixty pal equal one ghadi, which is 144,000,000 human years. Thirty ghadi make a day of Brahma, which is the equivalent of 4,320,000,000 human years.
11 "The passing of four yugs is called a chokadi. Satya- Yug lasts for 1,728,000 human years; Treta-Yug lasts for 1,296,000 human years; Dvapar-Yug lasts for 864,000 human years; and Kali-Yug lasts for 432,000 human years. This means one chokadi is completed in 4,320,000 years; and the one thousand chokadi pass in one day of Brahma. In one day of Brahma, fourteen Manus and fourteen Indras reign and die. Each Manu and Indra reign for 308,571,428 years, six months, twenty-five days, forty two ghadi, fifty one pal, twenty-five nimish, and forty two and 12/14 lav. Fourteen such Manus and Indras are created and destroyed during one day of Brahma. Countless creatures die throughout the day of Brahma. This is called nitya-pralay.
12 "When one night of Brahma passes and he retires to sleep, the ten loks between Svarg-Lok, Mrutyu-Lok, and Patal are destroyed. Brahma's night is as long as his day. Therefore, one of Brahma's night and day together lasts for 8,640,000,000 human years. The lower ten loks of the brahmand are therefore destroyed daily. At the end of the day, a new set of loks are created, which in turn will be destroyed as well. This is called nimit-pralay, which is the duration of Brahma's whole day.
13 "Thirty days of Brahma make one month; twelve months make one year; and a hundred years is the lifespan of Brahma. When Brahma dies, the brahmand, which consist of the fourteen loks, is destroyed. Then, all the entities that have evolved out of Prakruti are absorbed back into Prakruti. This is called prakrut-pralay.
14 "The fourth type of destruction is atyantik-pralay. This is when countless millions of brahmands are destroyed. At that time, even Prakruti-Purush draws countless brahmands within itself, and is then eclipsed by the light of Akshar. This is called atyantik- pralay.
15 "At the time of creation, everything evolves from Prakruti-Purush in the exact reverse order from which it was absorbed during the time of destruction. I have therefore described the four types of destruction.
16 "The third type of destruction, prakrut-pralay, is the end of the lifespan of Brahma. A jeev misuses its human body, which it receives after 350,000,000 prakrut-pralays, for the sake of worthless worldly pleasures and by the refuge of a false guru. As a result, it has to suffer the torments of Yam-Raj and the agonies of the pits of Narak. Moreover, it receives another human birth in a place where kalyan is attainable only after passing through the sufferings of the cycle of 8.4 million life forms (after another 350,000,000 prakrut-pralays). This is the interval before a jeev receives a human birth again.
17 "Therefore, having understood this today, and having sought the refuge of a s adguru, who is the granter of kalyan, and having kept your body, indriyas, and antah-karans in accordance with his wish, make every effort for the benefit of your atma and reach the dham of Bhagvan. If you do not realise this fact today and waste this human body, which is instrumental in attaining moksh, you will have to wait for the aforementioned time before you receive another chance like this. Only after such suffering and only at the end of that interval will you receive another opportunity to attain moksh, and that too if you make every effort for it. If you do not, you will not attain moksh. This is a fundamental principle. The wise should think about this. On the other hand, fools will never understand this since they have no respect for the Shrutis or Smrutis."

karma - Action. Deed. Any thought, word, or deed that will sooner or later reap its consequences. Karmas of a person are linked to their rewards (cause and effect). Bhagvan is the giver of the rewards of the karmas; good deeds reap pleasant rewards, and bad deeds reap painful fruits. Karmas remain with a jeev until it has received its rewards.

Also, He recited the epic poem, the Bhagvad Geeta, to Arjun in which He stated: 'Whenever dharma declines and adharma increases, I shall incarnate myself as a human to save the holy, to destroy the sin of the sinner, and to establish dharma. I come into being from yug to yug'. 2) In the Vachanamrut, Shreeji Maharaj also uses the name "Shree Krishna" to describe Bhagvan Purushottam Narayan.

The greatness of the mantra is described in 'Je Swaminarayan Nam Leshe' from Shree Hari-Leelamrut. The "Swaminarayan" name burns the sins of those who speak it. Bhagvan's names are in many shastras, but this is considered the greatest. Saying "Swaminarayan" once, is like saying other names thousands of times. No-one can describe the rewards we receive from saying "Swaminarayan". The mantra is so great, that all your desires are fulfilled by it. It brings happiness and destroys sorrows, and allows you to attains Akshardham. If it is heard at the end of life, even a sinner can attain moksh. Evil spirits run from the mantra. Wisdom awakens after hearing "Swaminarayan". The yamduts fear those who say "Swaminarayan". As water washes the body, "Swaminarayan" cleanses the soul

Virat -Purush - 1) An ishvar 'conceived' by one of the countless pairs of Pradhan-Purush. A svarup assumed by Bhagvan through Purush and Prakruti, and through whom He then grants Brahma and other jeevs their bodies. By nature, he is like a jeev, with his actions also being similar to that of a jeev – but with a lifespan of two parardhs (2 x 1017 human years). The creation, sustenance, and destruction of this brahmand are his three states. [Gadhada II – 31]. 2) He is also the physical world ( Virat-Purush) or a brahmand, which is a human form. However, it is beyond visualisation due to its immense size. Also known as Purush- Avatar. [Gadhada I – 63].

vishalya-karani - An ancient herbal medicine considered to relieve a person of any stab wounds in the body by causing the weapon that he has been stabbed with to fall out from the body.

vishay - An object indulged in by the jeev through the ten indriyas (senses). The five types of vishays are: sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches ( panch-vishays). The jeev cannot remain without indulging in the vishays. However, vishays related to Bhagvan strengthen the jeev, while vishays related to the world pollute the jeev. The jeev's deep desire to indulge in the pleasures of the vishays deflects it from the path of kalyan. [Gadhada I – 8].

The svarup consists of four different forms: Vasudev, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, and Sankarshan. They each have different roles and responsibilities in a brahmand ( Virat-Purush). Sankarshan, Aniruddha, and Pradyumna are the sagun svarups of Vasudev Bhagvan, and it is the strength of the upasana of Virat-Purush that he becomes capable of performing the activities of creation, sustenance, and destruction. Also, as long as Virat-Purush worships these three, his association with Maya – in the form of creation, sustenance, and destruction – is not broken. It is when he worships Vasudev Bhagvan, who is nirgun, that Virat-Purush abandons Maya and becomes brahm-rup.

vivek - Wisdom. Discretion. Carefulness. Good judgment.

vrat - An observance, usually consisting of an upvas.

vrutti - Concentration. Focus. The jeev's vrutti can be thought of as the jeev's focus of attention. The jeev can experience the physical world ( Virat-Purush) through the indriyas. Similarly the jeev can think about, or have a desire about the world through the antah-karans. When the jeev's attention is focused on a physical object through the indriyas, it can be said that the vruttis of the indriyas are focused on that object. Similarly, when the jeev's attention is focused on an object via the antah-karans, it can be said that the vruttis of the antah-karans are focused on that object. Also, like the focus of attention, the vrutti can be focused on many things at once with different levels of intensity. Also, just as the jeev can focus its vrutti outwards, it can also focus it inwards on itself or on Paramatma residing within.

vyom - Space ( akash); present in pruthvi, jal, tej, and vayu, but it remains unaffected by them. A chihn on Swaminarayan Bhagvan's left foot. Similarly, a bhakta performing dhyan on this chihn remains detached from the material world and Bhagvan resides within the purified space of his heart ( hruday-akash).

He drew on the works of Manu, and sometimes even paraphrased several of Manu's verses into his own words. The teachings of the shastra include dharma, legal procedures, tyagis, tap, and moksh. One of the eight shastras accepted as trustworthy by Swaminarayan Bhagvan.

yagnopavit - A sacred white thread, worn from the left shoulder to the waist. It is worn by brahmans. A ceremony (upanayan) is performed when the yagnopavit is received, usually after the age of seven.

This is the reward of the yog-yagna.

yojan - Measure of distance equalling four gaus (approximately 3-4 miles).

yug - Era. Age. Division of time used to outline the time-scale of the world. There are four yugs: Satya-Yug (Era of Goodness), Treta-Yug (Era of Three), Dvapar-Yug (Third Era), and finally, the present age, Kali-Yug (Era of Darkness).

The chihn on the feet of Swaminarayan Bhagvan
Right Foot
jav - A barley grain; located on the right toe. Performing dhyan on this chihn destroys all sins, purifies the mind, and grants a person with the knowledge of atma and Paramatma. It also grants worldly wealth and comforts.
jambu - A berry. Performing dhyan on this chihn ensures that a bhakta loses interest in everything else and feels that all worldly affairs are worthless.
vajra - The vajra is a weapon as long as a trident which is carried by Indra. Performing dhyan on this chihn helps a bhakta overcome his inner enemies, and removes the desires for material pleasures, which enables the mind to focus on Bhagvan.
urdhva- - Line. This chihn runs from the space between the big toe and the rekha first toe to the heel of the right foot. Performing dhyan on this chihn spiritually elevates the mind and takes the bhakta to Akshardham.
dhvaj - A flag. A flag sits above a mandir, and is also carried by the chief warrior of an army. A flag also symbolises victory. Performing dhyan on this chihn leads a bhakta to live by the agna of Bhagvan, just as a flag flutters according to the direction of the wind. It also helps a bhakta overcome lust and other material desires.
kamal - A lotus. Performing dhyan on this chihn enables a bhakta to remain free of material attachments and focus his mind on Bhagvan. Just as a kamal is able to blossom even in muddy water, similarly, a bhakta is able to remain free of material attachments, despite fulfilling all his worldly duties obligations. Also, just as a kamal does not sink into water, a bhakta is not submerged by the forces of inner enemies, attachments, and material pleasures.
ankush - An instrument used to control an elephant. Performing dhyan on this chihn enables a bhakta to control his mind, and to become strong in worshipping Bhagvan.
ashtakon - An octagon. Performing dhyan on this chihn grants a bhakta the fruits of ashtang-yog. He also attains Akshardham, which is beyond the eight barriers.
svastik - This sacred sign symbolises the focusing of Bhagvan's energy from all four directions to the centre. Performing dhyan on this chihn grants the bhakta a happy life free of misery, and good luck.

Left Foot
matsya - A fish. Performing dhyan on this chihn grants a bhakta with a stable mind. It also empowers him to live life absorbed in the murti of Bhagvan.
trikon - A triangle. Performing dhyan on this chihn frees a bhakta from the bondage and the three bodies – sthul, sukshma, karan; and the three mental states – jagrat, svapna; sushupti. He becomes brahm-rup.
gaupad - A cow's footprint. Performing dhyan on this chihn causes the vast material world to become the size of a cow's hoof.
dhanush - A bow; symbolises humility and strength. Performing dhyan on this chihn makes a bhakta humble, wise, polite, and fearless. It also enables him to overcome inner enemies.
vyom - Space ( akash); present in pruthvi, jal, tej, and vayu, but it remains unaffected by them. Similarly, a bhakta performing dhyan on this chihn remains detached from the material world, and Bhagvan resides within the purified space of his heart ( hruday-akash).
ardha- Half moon. The moon symbolises peace. A bhakta performing chandra dhyan on this chihn overcomes all miseries and experiences inner peace and profound happiness. Also, just as the night-lotus blossoms due to the light of the moon, the bhakta blossoms with bhakti and shraddha through the light of Bhagvan.
kalash - A brass water-pot. By performing dhyan on this chihn a bhakta attains total fulfilment and becomes akshar-rup. A kalash occupies the highest point on the shikhar of a mandir, and so the bhakta attains the highest dham, Akshardham.

Swaminarayan Bhagvan incarnated on earth, along with His dham and some of His muktas, to establish ekantik dharma, and grant kalyan to those who became His bhaktas. He incarnated at Dharma-Dev's house in Chhapaiya in Kaushal-Desh, to save Bhakti-Mata and Dharma-Dev from harassment by demons. He also incarnated to take mumukshu bhaktas to Akshardham, by imparting knowledge of His svarup, dharma, vairagya, and bhakti. While on earth, He established ekantik dharma, which had been destroyed many years ago, and He destroyed adharma. He initiated over 2000 sadhus, of which 500 were initiated as paramhans. Also, He built mandirs, and installed murtis, which will always remain on earth. In this way, Bhagvan forever resides on this earth through His sadhus and His murtis. Swaminarayan Bhagvan also wrote and narrated shastras, authenticated ancient shastras, and instructed His sadhus to write shastras.

Appendix C – Introductory Paragraphs
The introductory paragraph of each Vachanamrut begins with the date and location, which takes the reader back in time to the exact environment in which the sabhas were held. This is followed by a detailed description of Shreeji Maharaj's svarup, which allows the readers and listeners to visualise Him sitting in the sabha, giving His spiritual talks to the sadhus and haribhaktas.

Garments
angarkhu - A long-sleeved, upper garment that is made of a thin cloth. It reaches down to the knees, and is tied with strings on the left side of the chest.
bokani - Cloth tied around the head, with one end crossing from under the chin to cover the ears and cheeks.
chadar - A thin blanket.
dagli - Waistcoat with inner lining. Shorter and thicker than an angarkhu.
dhoti - An unstitched, long piece of cloth traditionally worn by males as a lower garment. It is usually wound around the waist with one end tucked in after passing it between the legs.
feto - Long piece of cloth that can be twisted and tied around the head, or placed over the shoulder and tied around the waist.
jamo - A long-sleeved, upper garment that is made of a thick cloth, with rich embroidery. It reaches down below the knees, and is tied at the waist with long strings.
khes - Piece of cloth that can be worn as a shawl to cover the upper body, or worn as a dhoti to cover the lower body.
pagh - Turban. Long, thin piece of cloth tied around the head..
rajai - Thick blanket.
reto - Feto, moliyu or shelu with silky, decorative edges woven with golden or silver threads. Tied around the head or waist, or left to rest upon the shoulders.
shelu - Rich fabric with a silky finish woven with golden or silver threads and decorative edges. It is worn as an upper garment or tied around the head or waist, or even left to rest upon the shoulders.
surval - Loose trousers.

Garments worn in cold weather
Maharaj wore warm clothes during the winter. For example, during the katha in Gadhada I – 24, He wore a warm dagli. Also, in Loya 1, Loya 3, and Loya 7, Shreeji Maharaj wore a cotton-padded surval. From all the garments worn by Shreeji Maharaj, we can deduce that the three coldest days in the Vachanamrut may have been in Loya, as Maharaj wore double layers on top of His warm dagli.

The three coldest days:
1. Magshar vad 13 - a warm dagli, khes, feto around His head, tied a bokani with another feto, covered Himself chofal and a pachhedi 
2. Magshar vad Amas - a warm dagli with an angarkhu inside, khes, tied a feto around his head, tied bokani with another feto, covered Himself chofal and a rajai
3. Posh sud 1 -  a warm dagli, khes, tied a feto around his head, tied bokani with another feto, covered Himself chofal and a rajai

Notes:
1. As Shreeji Maharaj possessed intense vairagya, He preferred simple white clothing.
2. Shreeji Maharaj generally wore a dhoti, referred to as a khes. A white dhoti is only mentioned twice in the Vachanamrut, in Gadhada II – 34 and in Jetalpur – 5.
3. He rarely wore a surval, but when He did, He preferred a white one, rather than one made of kinkhab. He only wore a kinkhab surval when it was presented by a loving bhakta.
4. He rarely wore an angarkhu, dagli, or jamo. He usually draped one of the following garments on His upper body: thin cotton cloth, thick cotton cloth, chadar, khes, reto, or shelu.
5. Shreeji Maharaj rarely wore rich garments with embroidery.
6. He wore a white, English-milled cloth during the katha in Gadhada III – 31.

Adornments
The paramhans and bhaktas often adorned Maharaj with various items. They offered Him flowers, hung garlands around His neck, placed bunches of flowers above His ears or inserted them into His pagh, hung tassels of flowers from His pagh, and tied strings of flowers to His wrists and arms.

Notes:
1. There are no flowers in the Panchala sabhas, either because the area was not fertile enough for growing flowers or the weather in Fagan was not warm enough for flowers to grow.
2. There are no flowers in the Loya sabhas. This may be due to the cold winter. Also, there are no flowers in winter months of Gadhada II, until the month Chaitra.
3. The rose only appears twice in the sabhas in Gadhada. Roses probably did not grow in the Saurashtra region. So, the roses in the two sabhas may have been brought by bhaktas visiting from other regions. All the other references to roses occur in the Gujarat sabhas (Vadtal and Amdavad). In the Amdavad sabhas, Maharaj adorns roses in the form of tora, bajubandh, guchh, and garlands.
4. The dolariya flower only appears in the Jetalpur kathas.
5. In Jetalpur 3, Maharaj adorns six varieties of flowers: champa, borsali, guldavadi, chameli, dolariya, and hajari, in addition to holding a lemon in one hand and a pomegranate in the other.
6. Sandalwood paste is usually applied during the summer months for its cooling effect. In the Vachanamrut, it was smeared on Maharaj three times: one during the month of Posh, and twice during the month of Fagan. Both months have low temperatures, with Posh being colder than Fagan. Therefore, Maharaj may have accepted the sandalwood from a great sadhu or a devout bhakta, as it is only soothing during the summer months.


1.  Brahma lives for 100 years (3.1536 x 1014 human years). Each year is made up of 365 days. At the end of his 100-year lifespan, prakrut-pralay occurs, in which the whole brahmand (the 14 loks) is destroyed. A new brahmand is then created, with a new Brahma.
2. Brahma's whole day is made up of 24 hours: a 12-hour day and a 12-hour night (8.64 x 109 human years).
3. During Brahma's day, the lower 10 loks of the brahmand are created; and they are destroyed during the night. This is called nimit-pralay. The lower 10 loks are then created the next day. (The upper four loks are created during Brahma's first day, and they are not destroyed until Brahma dies, and prakrut-pralay occurs)
4. During Brahma's 12-hour day (4.32 x 109 human years), 14 Manus and Indras reign and die, and 1000 Maha- Yugs ( chokadis) occur.
5. A chokadi is the passing of four yugs: Satya- Yug lasts for 1,728,000 human years; Treta-Yug lasts for 1,296,000 human years; Dvapar-Yug lasts for 864,000 human years; and Kali-Yug lasts for 432,000 human years. This means one chokadi is completed in 4,320,000 human years. Therefore, 1000 Maha- Yugs occur during one day of Brahma. The destruction that occurs during the day of Brahma is called nitya-pralay.


Appendix G – Conversion of Measurements
In the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan Bhagvan has referred to various measurements of time using traditional Hindu time scales. Below is a list of Indian time measurements with modern conversion equivalents.
1 krati = 34,000th of a second
1 truti = 300th of a second
2 truti = 1 luv (1/150 of a second)
2 lav = 1 kshan (1/75 of a second)
30 kshan = 1 nimish (2/5 of a second)
60 nimish = 1 pal (24 second)
60 pal = 1 ghadi (24 minutes)
2.5 ghadi = 1 hora (1 hour)
24 hora = 1 diwas (1 day)
7 diwas = 1 saptash (1 week)
4 sapta = 1 mas (1 month)
2 mas = 1 rutu (1 season)
6 rutu = 1 varsh (1 year)
100 varsh = 1 shatabda (1 century)
10 shatabda = 1 sahasrabda (1,000 years)
432 sahasrabda = 1 yug (length of Kali-Yug, 432,000 years)
2 yug = 1 Dvapar-Yug (864,000 years)
3 yug = 1 Treta-Yug (1,296,000 years)
4 yug = 1 Satya-Yug (1,728,000 years)
10 yug = 1 Maha-Yug = 1 chokdi (4,320,000 years)
1000 maha-yug = 1 kalp (4,320,000,000 years)
1 kalp = 4.32 billion years


Appendix H – Hindu Calendar
The Hindu calendar year is based on the Vikram era, after King Vikram of Ujjain. The system is still widely used in Northern and Western India. The calendar began in 57-56 BCE. The twelve months of the year are lunar-based, where each month is divided into the bright half (waxing of the moon), known as the 'shukla' or 'sud', and the dark half (waning of the moon), known as the 'krishna' or 'vad paksh'. The 15th day of the sud half (full moon), is known as Punam, while the last day of vad half (new moon), is known Amas. In Northern India, the months end on the day of the full moon, while in Gujarat, the months end on Amas, the darkest night. The lunar calendar, is approximately 354 days long. To keep it synchronised with the solar calendar, in which years are approximately 365 days long, adjustments are made to the lunar-based calendar every 2.5 years. This is achieved by adding an additional month called an 'adhik' or 'Purushottam' month to the calendar. In Gujarat, the Kartiki Samvat is used, where the new year begins after Divali on Kartik sud 1. The Ashadhi Samvat still prevails in some parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat – in Kutch and Saurashtra. In this system, the new year begins on Ashadh sud 1. The Vachanamrut is written using the Ashadhi Samvat. The Common Era year corresponding to the Samvat year is obtained by subtracting 57 years from the Vikram year if the date falls between ashadh sud 1 and December 31st; and 56 years if the date falls between January 1st and Jyeshtha vad 15.
